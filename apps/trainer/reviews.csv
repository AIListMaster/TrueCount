"Visited the place with family friends to savour the south Indian dishes which we were told was best in the town.The entire experience was awesome. The food, the ambiance and the service. All was top class.We not only enjoyed Dosa, but also chole-bhature and ice creams.Highly recommend.",2

"Me and my sister visited there for some snacking.We were out for shopping and after that we wanted to eat something yummy and not so heavy, so we decided to explore newly opened Sindhi Sweets at Sector 11.We tried their Rasmalai, Red velvet pastry, gajar ka halwa, veg puff and Bhalla papdi chaat.Everything looked nice and was served well.The seating area near chaat counter is where we sat. The restaurant looks nice and felt okay, but this seating near the chaat counter felt a bit dark. (Not lit enough)Out of all the things I tried, Gajar ka halwa and Veg puff tasted the best.Rasmalai had a flavour of milk powder/ condensed milk or custard mix.Red velvet wasn‚Äôt very fresh, it tasted okay.The chaat was also okay-ish taste wise.Gajar ka halwa on the other hand was really good and perfectly sweet. Veg puff also was flaky and tasted good.We had a nice experience altogether.They have large variety of cookies, gift packs and of course sweets, which look and taste good. :)",2
"Conveniently located in the sector 11 market, but parking can be a challenge here.Sindhi Sweets is a treat for people with a sweet tooth. Tried the rasmalai which was above average, though the serving size was decent. I only wish the syrup was little thicker and sweeter. The flavor at the Elante mall shop is far better!The gulab jamun was big and yumm and the rabdi was good.The service was quick and the people behind the counter are polite and helpful.The shop offers a huge variety of delicacies to choose from.Overall the place is great to satisfy your taste buds.",2

Sindhi sweets offers good variety in vegetarian options.Ordered their hyped chane bhature but didn't like it. Paani golgappa was also a disappointing dish here. Although chaats and sweets are much recommended here as they offer freshly prepared motichoor Desi ghee laddoos.Ambience is great.It mostly has heavy rush on weekends.Suggestion - They should add some more combo/ platter food options in their menu.Vegetarian options: This restaurant is pure vegetarian and offers large variety of veg options.,2
"Surprisingly the food was horrible when we dined for breakfast last Saturday.The so hyped Chole Bhature were super disappointing, rather the aloo ki sabji given along was better than Chole itself.We had ordered Masala Dosa, Rava Paneer dosa - insane.Who adds coriander leaves in masala dosa - needs good training there. We were group of 10 and none of us could finish individual dishes that were ordered.The great thing was Sweet lassi which we liked and above expectation. But guys your food quality has gone down so bad that we won‚Äôt dine ever there. I‚Äôm shocked to still think of so worse Chole Bhature.. ideally that must be your signature item on the menu. And when I‚Äôm writing this, trust that I‚Äôm a food connoisseur and know versatility of food. Your production team needs a real hard work.Service was good and appreciation to them.Genuine feedback by a hotelier.",0
"Great place to eat. I really loved this place. The staffs are great and food is very tasty.   one of the most hygienic place for your street food and sweet tooth cravings in Tricity.I love all the braches of Sindhi Sweets due to their services and delicious food.Must try dishes and my personal favorites are1.Chole Bhature2.Pani Puri and Dhai puri3. Cake4. Noodles5.Pav bhaji6. Kaju Katli7. Fresh LadduAnd ofcourse u can pick any sweet or Namkeen and they are the best.I have also tried their grill sandwiches, cake and they all taste amazing. Cheers For #SindhiSweetsTeam sector 11 Panchkula.",2
The food was overpriced as the price and quantity were not proportionateThe chaat and desert were comparitively still really niceThe service and atmosphere was decent as well,1
"The food was good..nice place to be there with family and friends... sindhi's special channa bhatura and üòã üç¨ üç´ With a welcoming ambiance and attentive staff, you'll feel right at home. The sweets are perfect combination of flavors and textures. The generous portion size ensures a satisfying quality, Don't miss this delicious experience in sidhi sweets üòã",2
"Place beautiful but lighting is dim so if u r a dim light lover u can go here, food is average some stuff is gud some is nt tht gud but I still love Anupam sweets more than sindhi sweets. Parking space is available it's near or on the road u can dine or take away easily.",2
"Ordered chana bhatura and rajkachori. Quality was not good as it used to be...as I visited so many times before.
Chana kulcha aalo sabzi was like in Puri aalo plate. Chana taste was also flat.
Rajkachori shell was hard and dry. Hope the manager will check it.",0
"Recently I visited SINDHI SWEETS, which is located in sector 11, Panchkula. I was really excited to taste amazing food.So I tried their Chana Bhature - which was super delicious. Then I tried their Raj Kachori, which was full of yumminess. Then we ordered mango lassi and vada.Mango lassi was really yumm.I didn't like the taste of Vada as Vada's flavor was just filled with black pepper only. So BIG NO to their Vada. But I will definitely gonna try their more food.Chana Bhatura  5‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Must try)Raj Kachori  5‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êMango Lassi  4.5‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êVada 1‚≠êQuality and quantity of food - Really Good.Gret staff and Service was excellent.Beautiful and fancy Ambience.

"No one can beat the quality of sweets of Sindhi Sweets. Firstly,we ordered paneer masala dosa...it wasn't crisp .... therefore, quality can be improved. Secondly, amritsari stuffed  kulcha was not crisp in the manner it should actually be. Quantity of channa should  be increased.",2
I asked a staff member about washroom and he directed me towards it very politely. I've never eaten here before but atmosphere is really good.,2
Sindhi sweets is one the finest family restaurant . They serving quality and delicious food for ages . They recently opened up in Panchkula.This outlet is one of the biggest sweets shop in town .,2

Best place for corporate dining.we have been bringing our clients for dinner and lunch ...Excellent staff..Nareshji leaves no stone unturned in serving our clients..very happy with experience....!!! Good food good staff,2
"Food is awesome and I recommend it for tasy food items , atmosphere is also good, what I noticed or you can say dont like is suddenly a big rat ran from the main kitchen to directly our table, which I think they should take care for hygenic part.Two times waiters dropped the plates kept on the counter.So on some points they nees improvements otherwise food is must try.",2
"Very Nice ExperienceClean, Very Nice sitting areaFood was well madeNot too spicy as you mostly expect when eating outside üòúService was fast and courteousPricing genuineOnly reason I am giving 4starts for food is to motivate them to brainstorm and make it even better.",2
Pathetic behaviour of Mr Naresh and all the the staff ‚Ä¶ very bad experience. They just don‚Äôt know how to talk ‚Ä¶ very Rude behaviour,0
Sindhi sweet as known for sweets.Most delicious  and quality is superb.i love laddo barfi which is awesome.Must try.Enough parking area and sitting and dinning is superb.,2
We had such a great dinner followed by our last dish Haka noodles. Extreme raw onions ruined the dish and it's sharpness brought tears to eyes and bitter Onion taste . Reported to Naresh and he was very argumentative and ruined our whole dinner experience. No help. Not coming again,0
Good food cool atmosphere and quick service. Quality of food is really good,2
We have been coming to Sindhi sweets panchkula since opening.We are always greeted and personally attended by Mr.Naresh ji who always makes sure we have a pleasant and fulfilling experience. We would highly recommend sindhi sweets to all.,2
"Very bad experience, money value is zero. Went after watching advertisements in newspaper poori with petha and aloo and in actual they are serving chhole instead on petha. It took me 46 minute to get my order that too at last when i asked them i will wait only for 1 minute or i will go then they brought it. Manager, cashier staff was clueless what‚Äôs going on. In front of manager after scolding him i asked the new to be customers to not order anything as they are taking so much of time, the manager was not interested in asking them to stay or consoling us to not to do so. Pathetic experience, very bad staff and management is zero.",0
"A great place to hang out with your friends, colleagues and family. Great food and the best part is that they have even started serving biscuits with this tasty masala tea which gives it an additional taste.",2
"Ordered Chana Bhatura with Pineapple Raita. Chana Bhatura was fine but quantity was too little. Worst experience with Pineapple Raita, it was just Meethi dahi with a Piece of Pineapple piece over it. Also ordered Chilly Garlic Noodles, which was loaded with Oil.",1
"Sindhis has always been one of my favorites for sweets, quick snacks and dining in once in a while.This Sindhis in Panchkula sector 11 is centrally located. Very well stocked and always great quality products. The restaurant offers a variety of options too.There could be a challenge in finding a parking spot inside the market area; so avoid driving inside if you see too many cars. Better to park along the road if you see other cars parked roadside.",2
One of the best places to dine with family‚Ä¶ we would like to thank Mr Naresh for excellent hospitality and fine dining experience,2
"For people like me coming from the US, this is a treat. Although we get all Indian snacks in the US, the quality and taste here is so different and good.
Comfort food.",2
This is my 1st experience. In manu there are  many items to eat. And they are very tasty.But in my second time I ordered Dal halwa it's not good as much as I eat before . And also Dhai gol gappe it's like Items are not fresh. They have good sitting area but they are not good in food.,1
"The restaurant has a cozy and inviting atmosphere, and the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive.
Also the food was amazing.",2
The food is  good  and great place  and  the  staff is soft- spoken especially shashi paul and especially chana bhatura is very tasty üòã,2

Have been a regularly visiting Sindhi Sweets in Sector 17 Chandigarh since I was a kid. Love their variety in snacks n sweets. So glad that they opened up an outlet in Panchkula.,2
"Food is ok, but the senior staff is very rude. I called them for a table booking as our guests were more than 10, I talked to two different people and both were very rude. They didn't have even basic etiquettes to talk and were not even concerned about any booking. Very bad experience, was not expecting this from Sindhi Sweet, Sector 9, Pkl. So I got my booking done at some other place.",0
Excellent staff and food. We would thank Naresh ji for his hospitality in giving us a good food experience.,2

"Somehow I got to know about this New Sindhi‚Äôs franchise opened at Panchkula. Thought of trying it and it turned out to be awful. The service sucks, the cleanliness was worst and the food was tasteless. This is very hard for me to digest such a renowned brand is getting destroyed just because people who own these franchisees are depleting it day by day.",0

"One of the finest sweet shop chain in north india. They have a great rasgullas other sweets are just fine like others nothing extraordinary. Kachori, pakoras are great too. Golgappa and chat is average. Coming to restaurant section: great dosa, average bhaturas, good manchurian but pathetic noodles. Last time as well i asked specifically that don‚Äôt put too much oil but i guess they don‚Äôt listen. In overall i will go again for dosa for sure.",0
I had my team party over there but yes quite overpriced and food was fine but with low quantity,2

"The place is one of the most popular for dine in around the area and is very busy during the weekends. Wait times are not that high, food quality and taste is consistent across their chain and most of the items have a tinge of sweetness given the sindhi cuisine. Service suffers at times given the kind of rush they have, but the servers do their best.",2

"Food was fine, service could hv been better. The masala dosa filling is spicy, do keep in mind.",1
"Top quality bakery products , neat and clean ambience. Good place to visit",2
Sindhi sweet is good as compared to their competitors in Tricity. They should work on the staff‚Äôs training though as they are not responsive and need to learn customer service skills.,2
"Literally third class experience in your outlet sector 11 panchkula your staff is so rude , no one os listening to the order like literally worst the most worst experience he uses so cheap like galli chaap language please look into this matter",0
"Thought of trying Sindhi panchkula first time with family..Chole bhature were pathetic..means no taste of chole ,they were sweet as hell..aloo subzi again was tasteless..the thali presentation was extremely poor..had to ask for pickle to eat bhature...Other members ordered Masala Dosa and they had the same feedback regarding Dosa taste and quality...Then and there only I told the waiter that don't the chef taste its own product to see what he has made or some person responsible for food quality...it looked he went inside to communicate the but never responded back to me..I will never visit Sindhi again ...",0

"Dahi balla prepration is worst - 1star
But Soup is Good  -5star",2
The quality of the sweets sold by Sindhi Sweets is amazing. With a large variety of sweets you are likely to find most kinds of sweets. The price is on the higher end though. They have a restaurant as well but serve only Veg. The service staff is well behaved and polite.,2
"Lots of variations of sweets, which are so delicious & yummm. We visited restaurant too and had mouth watering dinner with our family.One of the finest sweet shop chain. Kachori, pakoras are great too. Golgappa and chat is average. Great dosa, bhaturas, good manchurian but not happy with noodles. In overall i will go again for dosa for sure.",2
They make fraud when we order online. I have order some 3 plates and they delivered half of the order and they charge full amount,0

Cake  was delivered to us was entirely different than that we ordered. At the laat moment of fuction , we have to compromise as no.option was left with us. Rather than feeling sorry, the person at cake counter was talking rubbish and rude. I strongly advice the authority of Sindhi to look into the matter and direct the person to have some manner while dealing with customer because they are paying for the stuff. Really feeling bad...",0

These days Sindhi sweets is using lot of sugar in making their sweets. Pl reduce the sugar content.,0
Nice restaurant and sweet shop. Lots of seating capacity. But one negative issue is voice resounds and reverberations are felt due to non sound absorbing walls of the restaurant.  Good menu but steep prices.,2

I was really happy about that. They do not have license to serve liquor, you can get non-alcoholic beverages. Biryani was good and we were able to share one biryani ordered between me and my husband. I will definitely try some other brownies next time.",2
Very tasty biryani... staff is very good and well mannered.... just loved it...,2
"Food tastes good. The place is small, tends to get filled up quite quickly. The washroom is very neat and clean.",2
"I tried briyani first time in my life, and craving occurs because i watched so much youtube reviews, then i finalised to try it,and Its like heaven in first bite, Looking forward to try more itinaries soon,Packing is the first attraction point and quality of food is quite Superb and Masalas are so balancedalso they add A desi kind burner to heat it again at home or any location as per your comfort.",2
"Ordered 1Kg Biryani (Hyderabadi and Lucknowi) from Kilo....Delivered by Swiggy.Taste 0Quantity Rice 5Quantity Mutton/Chk 0The biryani had no gravy, we kept on mixing rice in both the biryanis but neither did we find any Masala nor did we find proportionate quantity of pieces in both of them. There was nothing but chillies in both the portions. All I can say is.... ""Naam bade aur darshan chote. """,0
"Not good at all, we ate mutton biryani but only found 2 mutton pieces,1 egg and potato taste was not good, only staff is good",0
"I have strongly recommend try once Biriyani by kilo.awesome taste ,you can't forget.",2
"Tried there Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani, i must say taste it‚Äôs delicious. Only drawback is you have to wait a bit for food preparation but the wait is worth.Ordered Paneer tikka as starters but was not good for the price it‚Äôs offered and the proportion was also small check the image.",2
"So we visited this place BBK. Too famous for it's biryani. Proper protocols were followed. On arriving temperature was checked and hands were sanitized. Next the glasses and plates have been set in the sanitized machine which is again a measure to avoid COVID - 19.Talking about ambience, it's really nice for family, friends. Low music with good lighting.Veg Byryani - seriously too yummy, the presentation is very good. All the vegetables are sorted and it was spicy so yes tastes awesome.Veg kabab - it was nice too, specially when served with green chutney.Then comes my favorite - Phirni which was really the best. I had it for the first time and really loved it. I would love to visit the place again.So if someone's here in tricity and want to have biryani or phirni, BBK is the best.",2
"Visited to this at night , ordered panner dum biryani. Kept us waited for long time outside, as they don't have space to accommodate takeaway people. its hardly a small place for dining, near about 10 to 12 at a the me can dine in. Taste was not so good as per the cost. Rice was over cooked as it is sticking doesn't look like dum biryani.  This I can make myself instead of going here , disappointed. Packing was excellent but I don't suggest here for food lovers.",0
"One of the finest brands when it comes to serving authentic biryanis in town. This place has always been a goto place in Chandigarh for my biryanis. Having much experience staying in Hyderabad and in love with the biryanis there, this is the closest if not perfect in tri-city if you are looking for one.They have always come up with nice menu additions and this time I tried their new chicken tikka biryani which was really nice too.",2
"The taste of the food is perfect, even when I ordered it at home, the taste was the same..",2
"Visited the place for the very first time, here are my honest observations:1. Though compact, the restaurant is beautifully decorated reflecting Indian Mughal history. Not only does the flooring match the said theme but also the furniture and the music. A quick advice to the owners would be to play a relaxing and calm music rather than the heartbroken one! ü§£ People visit such places to enjoy n laugh, the music doesn‚Äôt let them catch a break man. üòÜ2. The food is cooked and served in a traditional clay biryani pot. The texture and food quality was just amazing. The kababs, both veg and non veg just melted in mouth. Beverages, on the other hand, were yummy but served with a very less quantity, which was quite surprising!3. The restaurant followed all hygiene standards as per the status Quo COVID 19.4. The staff was quite respectful, professional and amicable. Not only were they well aware of the menu, but also explored some customer friendly offers.I hope the suggestions given by me to the restaurant owner would be taken with a positive spirit. Thank you for wonderful hospitality guys!",2
"Taste - 4/5Portions - 4/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 4/5 (‚Çπ1k for two approx.)Serving dum cooked handi biryanis, this outlet is located in sector 30, chandigarh.The place is small, the ambience is warm with dim yellow lights & elements that depict royal biryani history.I tried :1. Murg hyderabadi biryani - 4/5This was delicious, the rice was perfectly cooked, had good chicken pieces & flavours.However, the biryani tasted a bit dry & would have been better if the portions of salan & raita were proportionately increased.2. Peshawari chole biryani - 3/5This was an experimental dish, it had good flavours but nothing can beat the taste of classic biryani (non veg & veg)3. Chicken ghee roast - 5/5Absolutely loved the spices in this, the chicken was roasted generously in ghee.The dish was spicy, delicious, had beautiful ghee aroma & was served with tangy mint chutney.4. Imli adrak lemonade - 3/5Apt to the name, this was a refreshing drink & felt lighter, acted as a digestive on the heavy biryani & ghee roast.5. Sweet lassi - 4/5The lassi was decent, not very thick & creamy but had apt sweetness.6. Matka phirni - 4/5Couldn't have been a better way to end a biryani meal.This was sweet and creamy melt in mouth delicacy.",2
Do try Kolkata Biryani because it is least spicy. I love it. Also it comes with egg and a super tasty potato ball.Other items are good as well. Chicken tikka is also superb.Vegetarian options: All non veg items have similar preparations without meat.Parking: The whole market parking is availableKid-friendliness: Kids chair is availableWheelchair accessibility: The place is easily accessible using a wheelchair.,2
A wholesome experience at biryani by kilos. I have ordered chicken hyderabadi handi boneless biryani which was very delicious. I requested for add ons and it was provided. Value for money experience.,2
I really loved their Boneless Chicken Biryani with Salan!It really was unexpectedly amazing!It was a delivery order. I received the Biryani Hot! They also provided an extra utensil to re-heat the Biryani if needed along with 2 candles to heat the pot!The quantity was amazing!The taste was amazing!The boneless chicken in the Biryani was mouth watering!The order and pot were well sanitized and well sealed!Definitely ordering from here again!,2
"I had an opportunity to visit this place yesterday afternoon and it didn't disappoint me. Wonderful ambience and decor. Though they took time to make biryani (understandably), service was great. Food was delicious. We will be delighted to come back again.",2
We ordered it online and honestly I am not satisfied with the taste in this price.It looks expensive but i had better Hyderabadi biryanis's in less money.It won't create any hipe taste is basic there is not enough aroma.I can cook Biryani like this myself.Packing and presentation is 10 on 10 but the real taste is missing.Maybe it's their own way or recipe to cook but my expectations is in comparison of the briyani's i had in past it's not even close to that authentic taste.For taste it's 6 out of 10.,1
"I have visited this place so many times. This is the best place to have biryani. I just love their Murg Malamal Biryani. It is my favourite biryani. Then I've tried Chicken 65 which was also good. Coming to my second favourite dish here which is Mutton Galouti Kebab which is served with Parantha. This is a must try.The place is really good. The staff is amazing. I would rate this place 5/5. Whenever I go to Biryani by Kilo, I just repeat my order and order Murg Malamal Biryani. I just love it. This place will not disappoint you.",2
"For peaceful atmosphere, family outing and for those looking on a mouth watering dishes in combination with rice and lemonades. This place is a visit for sure. Good place. One of my favoriteüòçParking: Not that difficult. It is subject to availability of space.",2
"A restaurant located in market area of sec 30 Chandigarh, other one is located on airport road.This restaurant provides biryani as a meal along with raita or salan. One can order full Biryani or half biryani,  served in earthen pots.Taste freshness and quantity is 7/10. Ambience of the place is 7/10. Service quality is 5/10. Neatness is generally maintained7/10, but staff should also take care of removing flies floating around the guests, as experienced by self while dining. Pricing is 7/10, for the services offered.",1
"It was a great experience visiting The Biriyani By Kilo... As a Bong, the main attraction for me was about the Kolkata special biriyani which they did a fantastic job. Just a hinge remains when you hear you cannot an extra egg or potato with the handi you ordered...üòÇ",2
Popular for Biryani(i like kathal biryani)But DUM nihari gosht is a must try.You can literally feel the flavours on ur palate.The packaging is also very safe.Order at-least one hour before as its the preparation time.You‚Äôll get 4 peices in one plate.,2
"This outlet is so lonely.. no music, ambience is shabby, negative vibes although staff was gud n courteous n food was also decent. Owner should either shift the location or should make it lively. Very bad experience. I even had to get the food packed after ordering as sitting inside with family was too uncomfortable and bad.Vegetarian options: Limited options n we should call it pulao instead of veg biryani as this is what is served.Parking: Parking is always empty thanks to bad location.Kid-friendliness: Not kids friendly as it is a shabby place.",0
"I heard a lot about this restaurant, and finally I went there today. First impression from restaurants ambience was good.Then staff's service was also wonderful.I read a lot from Zomato's review so I was very curious.I ordered veg hydrabad biryani. They told me it will take 25 mins to prepare , I was also aware about the time taken to cook biryani. Staff told me that if one order for home delivery then they took 45-60 mins to prepare because they deliver in the same bowl in which it's cooked but in case of dine-in they use different material bowl that helps to cook faster.While you wait for your order they gives you papad with green mint sauce and with curd.After biryani was served on table and they opened bowl you will get to know restaurants speciality. Taste was very good, infact awesome . Biryani was served with gravy. Staff was so generous they get to know that its my first visit so they complimentary gave us sweet dish (Firni) thumbs up for their hospitality.I must recommend this for delicious biryani.",2
One of the best place for good tasty biryani. Tried their Hyderabadi Dum Biryani. It was yummy and the presentation and packaging was spot on. Portion size was apt for three. Salan also tasted good.,2
"One of the preferred destinations to enjoy some quality Biryani options in Chandigarh/ Tricity. Packing & takeaway service is also good. Plus, the ambience of the restaurant is quite good. Do visit with your friends and family members.",2
"The heavenly place for Biryani lovers! This place did not disappoint. üç¥Prepared authentically as per the loyal tradition, this place took its time to bring our orders but it was worth the wait after all. Excited to visit an outlet whenever I would get a chance.",2
"Heard alot about this place for the delicious biryani.I tried their Galouti kebabs and Hyderabadi Briyani.‚úÖkebabs are mostly known for their softness and prefect taste of spices ,So i can say i tasted one of the most delicious kebabs at Biryani by kilo in tricity.Amazingly perfect by taste.‚úÖNow comes to Briyani....it had rich taste of spices and well cooked rice layers but I don‚Äôt like it much as somewhere taste of real Briyani was not proper in this one.",1
"All the Biryani lovers , this one is all the way authentic from streets of Hyderabad speciality .A beautiful presentation of food in kulhad handis with Anch box Along with it to keep it on flames while you enjoy hot and spicy curries and spices .I‚Äôm completely impressed by the way they have delivered the food in properly packed dishes so the food keeps intact and will give you authentic satisfaction as well .Coming to what I had :-1. Hyderabadi veg biryani - 1/2 kg = 10/10 . Perfect spices giving the rich flavours of Hyderabadi food .2. Paneer - 1/2kg = 10/10 . Spicy and delicious.3. Ulte tawa ke parantha -10/10 . A bread is equally important along with the dishes as it completed the meal . Must try this one .4. Kulhad phirni -   Wish I could rate this 11/10 because it‚Äôs super delicious and I wanted to have more of it but complety worth for ending this royal meal .To all my Biryani lover friends , you‚Äôve to try this outlet .Thankyou Kilo by Biryani for giving me this amazing royal experience.",2
Amazing taste of Biryani economical rates.... Good Support of staff makes the ambiance more wonderful...If you a Biryani lover..... Must visit to enjoy....Even the other dish Paneer Hyderabadi tastes outstanding,2
The bariyani was good but the gulab jamun with rabri was not upto its price...also paneer ki sbji I don't remember it's name was a little sweet .plus point you get free starter if you go there to eat.online you don't get anything extra,2
"After Delhi, they have opened one of the outlet in Chandigarh. The biryani is amazing as they have cooked and best place for a biryani fan. It took 1/2 kg chicken Biryani which filled small stomachs of two people. The one star I have cut for the seating they have is very limited because this will grow at great pace so they really need to manage seating.",2
"Good quality food , clean and nice place good staff. I ordered 1/2 kg biryani , namkeen lassi , raita and their special phirni. Everything was up to the mark. The biryani was good but the 1/2 kg pot was not sufficient for two. The namkeen lassi was excellent. The raita was good and fresh.  And the phirni was also very nice . It's a must try place, the aura is lovely.Thanks !",2
"New place alert...!!  Everyone is big fan of biryani right but no one believe that there is any veg biryani . But they prove everyone wrong. Can‚Äôt even imagine that biryani looks damm tasty in veg. Love to have this i just feel the texture of vegetables in every bite. Serving way is damm good.  I just tried.  Biryani, ulte tawe ki roti, paneer nawabi,salam. Hydrabadi biryani was too good.. guys must try this delivery outlet one of the best place for having biryani üòçüòçüòçüòç",2
"Biryani done just right. Premium quality rice, aromatic and authentic taste.Packing is good which keeps all flavors intact in earthenware.A little pricey but totally worth it.They serve some appetizers like chicken 65 etc too. Also this is not in busy shopping area so parking is not a problem",2
The quantity of drinks is very less. Kinda 130 ml only. Taste is good. Biryanis are best. Ambience is good. Takes time since its the handi one.,2
"Tried Hyderabadi biryani with Galouti kababs, Service is ok, not very welcoming. Main part is Biryani, aroma was very nice but the taste was just ok. Takes alot of time to serve. Ambience is good",1
"Nice Ambience, friendly service, make your stomach quite with healthy Biryani.

Not a much big dine in space, but will suggest more for Couples üòâü§ûüèª",2
"Best place to have Biryani in chandigarh , I had hyderabadi  biryani there which is quite good in taste .They serve chicken Biryani , veg biryani and many other snacks as well .If you are looking for biryani then this is the place for youDont go there if you are looking for different varieties of food because they have limited options",2
"I visited the place yesterday and ordered Kolkata Murg Biryani. The waiter politely infromed me that it would take 40 min to prepare the Biryani. After 5 min they first served the papad with chatani and dahi. I enjoyed munching on the papad and the sogging in the instrumental music (Rafi, Kishore and Mukesh) and the ambiance of the place till my order was ready. The biryani was delicious and authentic Kolkata Biryani which must contain half piece potatoe, a boiled egg and of course murg. I enjoyed my meal. The staff are well mannered and best part is they inform you about the delay in preparing the food.",2
"We have order chicken 65 and Malabar chicken biryani..The chicken 65 was good as it has good taste and nice aroma of herbs they add to it along with the serving..so it was good .The biryani was hot ,served with gravy and raita ,but taste wise it was ohk ohk...aroma was very nice , very refreshing but I didn't find it that grt ...so biryani was also ohk ohk..but yes ambience was definitely grt...",1
"""Extremely disappointed with the quality of the biryani at Biryani By Kilo. The precooked biryani served in mere 5 minutes was dry and tasteless, lacking the authentic flavors and aroma that one expects from a good biryani. The chicken was tough and seemed like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for ages. The entire experience was far from satisfactory, and I urge others to be cautious while considering dining at Biryani By Kilo. Such substandard quality does not justify the prices they charge. Hope they take necessary steps to improve their food quality and service.""",0
Everything was so good in taste. My family and myself loved it so much.. Biryani was so authentic and Kebabs were really yum. Phirni was cherry on the top and so gooey. Packaging was so Perfect,2
The biryani is really but the overall experience is the one of the worst ever.First they kept us waiting for an hour after telling it will take 15-20 mins for a table.In meanwhile I was told to give the order so I would be served as soon as we get a table.Then they took another 20-25 mins to serve the order after making us wait for an hour outside the restaurant.,1
"Elegant ambiance with soothing instrumental music. Veg galouti kabab was bit too soft for our liking and less crispy on outside. Murg malamal biryani had good quantity of chicken, taste was also good but I'll prefer biryani with bone pieces next time. Veg Hyderabadi biryani was flavourful. Imli adraki lemonade and shikanji were refreshing. Overall good experience.",2
Lil bit pricey...the food service was slow since it is freshly prepared and takes time to cook...service and good...ambience is pretty neat and according to the theme of the place...the veg and mutton galouti were extremely delicious and melted right in the mouth ..cheese 65 was ok ok...in main course the mutton nihari and veg biryani was really good..the main course cottage cheese dish i didnt fknd anything extraordinary in it...must go at least once but keep in mind biryani takes at least 45 min to be cooked!!,2
Packing is good. But surprisingly the carry bag is so poor quality that it could not even carry biryani to my home (despite of getting it in my car) !!! Pls check this loss,0
Plz don't go here worst food ever in the briyani Hyderabadi taste only cloves as we say long and Kolkata briyani is so cheap and worst they add to much kewda jal so they taste like bitter. This is happening to me for the first time that I stopped eating and leave the food because the food was so worst that I felt like vomiting. Plz i suggest whenther you go good restaurants yaa I choose 15 Sector for briyani I know 15 sector has not good place to sit but they having delicious food not even they bbk food like  worst that üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§Æü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ plz don't go bbk so expensive and worst bbk we say that uchhe dukaan fikee pakwaan üò°,0
This is a very famous outlet in tricity for the biryani but i feel there are places that serve better biryanis at a far reasonable prices and more quantity.I found not special in the biryanis.,1
Nice ambience and food. But order befor hand for biryani because it take 30 min,2
"Best biryani, quite awesome experience. Biryani served in a pot, excellent service. If you haven't tasted it yet please go give your taste buds a rising taste.",2

Loved the food. One must go to taste the exotic biryani with so many flavors and tastes .  Service is bit slow but that is due to the preparation of the biryani but its woth waiting for it.Must visit with family and friends. I have taken the zomato gold 1+1 . It is also applicable. If you are biryani lover you must go there at least once.,2
A nice place to have biryani. Taste is great and the place is quite neat and clean. All safety measures being followed regarding covid.,2

"Food is not so good according to price.
Even the contity of food is less then the price changed",0
Hygiene and ambience is awesome here. Tasted veg luckhnowi biryani here... Was very yummy... If you want to eat little spicy one then try hyderabadi biryani...,2
Biriyani was just average when compared to actual hyderabadi dum biriyani. But this is the best available in the city.,1

The ambiance of the location and the takeaway facilities are wonderful...nice packaging and the taste as well..üòò,2
Tried Vegitarian Hydrabadi Biryani.. The taste was good n presentation superb.,2
The presentation is really good.  This is good place to have briyani.  I like the way they deliver the order.  Must go place at least once.,2
"Worst quality biryani, conmen‚Äôs and frauds while dealing with the customers. Shall never order it again. Deleting app. Behrouz is the best. Tried ordering for a change from BBK but turned out to be a nightmare for me.",0
"Very tasty biriyani. A bit costly. Not much
Must try",2
"Hygiene, service and ambience all were top notch. However, taste was nothing out of box. I had tastier biryanis even in small street shops.",1
"Order No 152023, Dt-03 Apr 2023, Place: Chandigarh. The mutton biryani which we ordered today was very very chewy and took a lot of effort to just eat it. We have ordered a lot in the past but never faced such bad food.",0
"Invoice number  10010
The hydrabadi biryani is one of the worst biryanis I have ever had it tasted foul and it was burnt and there is no reply from bbk team, we ordered biryani from sector 30c chandigarh",0
Veg hydrabadi biryani is the best here. We loved that,2
"One of the best hyderabadi biryani I have tasted in a place other than Hyderabad.Came in earthen pot with a pot having 2 candle to give extra DUM.Rice and chicken both were cooked to perfection with chicken as tender from outside as cooked upto inner layer.It was not as dry as the regular hyderbadi biryani, with an ample layer of gravy in it.Came in a sealed container keeping all the flavors of different condiments sealed in it.No spice was extra, balance of flavors with a little sweetness in between and with the Chilli of the gravy.Amount was good enough for 3 people but hunger can be increased seeing the taste.Must try",2
Was a long wait but results were pretty much edible. Good to know that the company also delivers in pkl!,2
"Best biryani in chandigarh,
The only problem is that they take much time to prepare it.But if u have enough time,then definitely u should visit here.",2
"Nice ambience.- Aam Drink is great- Masala Shikanji is okay okay- Hyderabadi Veg Biryani that we ordered looked bland even after mixing but when we tasted along with yoghurt, it was SIMPLY DELICIOUS.Recommended highly for that authentic flavour which lingers on your tastebuds.",2
"Not recommended. Very much disappointed.No flavours no aroma of Biriyani. Biryani was very dry, it should be lil moist. No taste except spice no flavours at all. Eggs in it were not fresh, egg yolks was dark.  And paying so high for this kind of biryani is not at all worth.You should focus on taste rather than advertising or trying to make it look attractive.Terrible experience.",0
"Staff members were very lazy with servingNo decency , how to deal with customersThey makes us wait too long . They don‚Äôt even served papad with sauces while waiting too long for biryani preparation .Overall it was a bad experience!",0
"so after hearing such rave reviews about the place, we decided to give it a shot, since it was our 1st order, we decided to play safe and ordered Hyderabadi Veg Biryani. It was good and tasty. service was the best in class.",2
Awesome place for dum biryani - real taste of hyderabadi üòãüòãüòã,2
"There were no customers in the outlet, charges are very high, portions of food are very less,",0
"Only one word for the food... ""AWESOME""I am a foody guy like to explore places with good taste, let me tell you guys this place is worth to visit. I have been to hyderabad,lucknow, kashmir, Kerala etc and this place is will satisfy your taste buds equivalently. Hyderabad Biryani tastes awesome and the deserts are tastier too, let it be gulab jamun with rabri or firni.All those are foody this is the place. Try it.",2
Great taste and fresh cooked biryani is served here.,2
Great Biryani. Awesome ambience. Nice staff. Moderate prices. Nice location. Just one suggestion : please include one or two combo meal options in your menu. Keep Growing kilo - by Tons :).......,2
"Had very high expectations which were badly shattered when I went to Biryani By Kilo.. the food was pretty average, I hated the service.. the ambience wasn't very positive..  the glasses were smelling..",0
Service is very very slow.Don't believe the HYPE. I spent around ‚Çπ2100/- on both Biryanis & platter.Not Up to The Mark.NOT WORTH SPENDING THIS AMOUNT HERE. TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE...!!!,0
I went with my wife and a toddler. He slept peacefully because of the ambience. The decoration and behaviour of staffs were awesome. And we liked the Kolkata dum biriyani too but portion seemed less. It was a nice experience.,2
It's ok... Biryani is good but other food items are just fine... But not worth the price.,1
"After hearing so much about BBK, I placed order online for half kg Boneless Chicken Biryani. Frankly speaking, my experience was very disappointing. Briyani was not only very spicy (despite specifically requesting that it should not be spicy)  but also very salty. There were hardly any chicken pieces and whatever little were there , were chewy. Quality control needs a stricter supervision for preserving the good reputation of BBK.",0
Dining experience was really good so we decided to take out something extra for later the packaging was really good and they also provide supplies to heat up our take out order . The order takes about 30 minutes but it is worth the wait. Better than behrouz for sure.,2
"There is no minus star so giving 1 star. The biryani was not worth and also the taste and texture was very poor.
Sometimes come to Hyderabad i will show how the biryani is.",0
"This is hands down the best biryani I have had ever in my life. The vibe of the restaurant is so soothing. I tried their fish pakora, and it was amazing. Highly recommend to everyone.",2
"This place serves one of the most authentic biryani. I have tasted Biryani at several outlets in Hyderabad who serve the best of Biryani. Believe me, the taste of Hyderabadi Dum Biryani served at Biryani by Kilo is almost equivalent to ones i tasted in Hyderabad. I think that sums it up.",2
Portion -3/5Price-3/5Presentation-4/5Quality-3/5I went there along with my two friends.While looking at the menu of biryani which says serves two - we order two biryani - murg Hyderabad biryani & malamal murg biryani. Both were served in pot with same gravy . If the gravy for both the biryani is same it will spoil the original taste of biryani.Second we need to stir the biryani for thoroughly mixing in the pot which is a little bit difficult task in the pot with spoon . The taste of malamal murg biryani was good while the Hyderabad murg biryani was below average. Chicken quantity both pot seems average. However chicken was thoroughly cooked . Given the pricing quantity & quality of biryani it seemed over priced & taste was average.,1
Good food .. good guys .. forgot to switch on AC ... rest all ok,1

"Their food variety & quality is unequivocally amazing ,at one point one feels quite confused with what really to buy cause everything looks top notch, albeit, their staff ,cashiers can enhance the experience but sadly they're just too arrogant or rather callous when comes to customer satisfaction! It's like they know customers will rush in no matter what so whats the point of a friendly approach!!As such I try to avoid such places where the basic respect for a customer is missing!!",1
This is the perfect #restaurant for celebrating birthday parties and kitty parties. Services provided are very fast. The place is neat and clean. And the food they serve is just #delicious. Prices are also very reasonable. Perfect family place. Staff is also very polite and gentle. Must try their GolGappe #AnupamSweets,2

"Delicious food üòã never forget the taste of fried rice Manchurian,dosa",2
Mediocre place serving mediocre food in my opinion.  Ordered idli which were cold and hard and when complained told me to dip it in the hot sambar - absolutely ridiculous.  They tell you how to eat your food!  Did like the seating area as was spacious but the toilets and hand wash basin were sub standard tbh.  Will not go again!,1
Service is normal outlet interior is very good food is also average,1
"Worst place, worst quality of food.See the pic of tandoori platter..worst I hv ever tasted. Also rava masala dosa cold n without salt. Dal makhni very bad taste. Aloo tikki not hot neither crispi.I wasted my evening today. Will never go again.",0

Sec 11 pkl .This is among the oldest sweet shop in the city probabily  35 year old or more.It is best price shop in its category of elite class and trained staff with absolute cleaniness.Shop has some polite waiters in there restaurant  section aged around 60 years even  working  there since 20 year to 35 years which is quite  interesting.This is pure vegetarian  shop.,2
"The food is not that great now. The restaurant used to be one of the best places to dine in, however it is no longer a case. One should I xplore more options before stepping in",1
One of the famous restaurants in Panchkula ! There is a lot of rush on occasions! Also the food quality is very good! Bakery items are fantabulous and Chinese is too good! Must visit!,2
"Staff  no manner talking using an language wrong wording use
Don't take an action.    Please disclose the warning only
Please mantane decorum.  Food and environment all over good",1
"Anupam Sweets is quite very old name in Panchkula. In Past, whenever anyone want to have some sweets everyone recommends Anupam Sweets. It was always knows for its quality. But now things are much changed now The quality of food, sweets and snacks re very much degraded. Now much people started preferring other sweet shop now. In last 6 months, I have tried snacks as well as sweets but the quality is not up to mark. In sweets the quantity of sugar has very much increased. In snacks, the quality is very degraded and started to cook much spicy.I think owner started to focus more on business then the quality of food. I will they will improve soon and serve better food to the people.",1
"Tasty cuisine
Nyc place
Interior is also really attractive üòç",2
"Great ambience with reasonable price, a good place for spending time with family and friends",2
This shop is the best sweet shop in tricity. A little expensive for sure but in terms of quality and taste i found Anupam sweets as the best. Plus they got the best Apple pie in town there are just incredible.,2
As it's becoming more popular gradually it's losing its taste and service quality.,2
"I am very precisely sharing my experience, The 2 stars here are for the sweets which are sold in anupam.. They are not doubt good..! But the restaurant and their staff is wierd also the food is not so good.. I ordered for one plate bhatoora chana they brought 2 .. I ordered for extra pav for pav bhaji they brought extra bhatoora.. I ordered paneer pakode and they are serving it without chutney can you imagine? These guys have chaat counter! and they cant serve chutneys! i asked for chutneys with chana bhatoora they refused..But when i asked chutneys for paneer pakoda they then said ya okay we will bring it then also they are giving only brown chutney and saying you asked for only sweet one! ( Which was their assumption).. I asked for both the chutneys..Lastly the paneer pakoda was not at all fresh and my whole family has suffered from indigestion..Also they didn't served chilled mojitos..Their service is really very badly managed.. I think they should give a proper training to their staff..Also i didn't liked the way they have managed their counters it becomes really confusing for a person visiting first time in their outlet... They should atleast put some labels near their counters ,for example Billing section , bakery section , reception etc..I experienced a lot of flaws and would hope that they could improve that.. Otherwise there is a good opportunity for their restaurant section atleast!..I would never try this place again for food atleast..",0
"The place was nice but the location is kinda hideous, the food was tasty too. You must try the Chilli Paneer, it is very tasty.",2
Always love to visit there. The quality of there foods are extremely extra ordinary.,2

Good Food vs Good Price along with Quick Service and Beautiful Ambience. One of the Oldest and Famous Restaurant chain in Panchkula.Editing my review after 3 years and Now they have renovated their entire restaurant seating and expanded as well. Must say they know how to change with time!! Good job.,2
"Food was great, service could be improved a little. Good ambiance, clean.",2
"The sweets are good enough.
The bakery items are very yum. Extremely good eggless bakery they have.
But the old famous chhole bhature's taste is spoiled. They have changed chef. It's disappointing. It's some yellow sabzi kind of chhole served now.",2
"Visited their restaurant multiple times, food is not too spicy, tastes good and plenty of options are available. Had a peek in their kitchen and things look hygienic there as well. Sweet shop is huge and has great variety of sweets and snacks. Washrooms are clean, seating area is also comfortable.",2
"Food tastes delightful everytime we visit here. They have pure desi ghee made sweets. Even their snacks like chaat papadi,golgappas, dhoklas,dosas etc are worth trying.",2
The food was of ok ok quality. We ordered pao bhaji and Chola bhatura. Pao bhaji was of ok taste but Chola bhatura was very bad in taste. There was no cleanliness in the restaurant. Flies were all over in the sitting area,0
"Food below average, South indian food below par & is not recommended at all Chinese food is just ok.. Sweets are good",0
The staff is not traned i just saw a issue when a person came back all the way from his house as a punding he order was not there what he paid for and then after i got billed for an extra pastry which i didnt even buy poor experience,0
Oh my God!!!I would love to eat anyday anytime food here as it is toooooo sumptuously tasty.My spouse stopped me or else I would have gulped down many a paranthazzzz.,2
"So I happened to purchase ""Rasmalai"" from these guys and boy they have disappointed me not once but twice. The ""ras"" tasted like sweetened verka packet dudh...Please don't buy rasmalai from here atleast.""Naam bade aur darshan chote"" hai.",0
Anupam is one of the oldest sweets shop in Panchkula. Their sweets are always delicious and have different varieties. Their restaurant is also good to grab a quick bite or to have a family dinning. Price is economical.,2
Prices and quantity arr inversely proportional but good quality.,2
Visited with family and had a great time. All dishes that we ordered were very delicious. Recommend for families and friends for outing.,2
"Indian vegetarian restaurant not serving Indian Masala Tea instead giving tea bag dip tea. Shame Shame.
Samosa also no taste of masala.",0
Lots of varieties were there but they need to improve their food quality. Paneer pakora was pathetic. Dhokla was good.,2
"Best sweet shop in town, great taste and flavours. Do try hot gulab jamun, milk cake, daal barfi, and kalakand. Best taste ever....",2
"We visited this place on 7th August to have a dinner. It was one of the worst dining experience. Food quality was pathetic. First they brought us cold paneer tikka which was totally tasteless. It seemed that it was prepared a long time ago. In the main course, we ordered karahi paneer which was also of pathetic quality. On top of it, there service quality was also very bad. They wanted us to leave the restaurant as soon as possible. It was evident from the fact that waiter just stood on our head after serving the sweet dish in the end. Very very bad experience experience.",0
"Worst chole bhature(bhatura is like papad you have jaw pain after eating dat papad bhatura n smell is also not like bhatura),too much red chilli in  alloo tikki (red chilli filling) and der dosa again something smelly like hell ""sambhar"""" to pucho na...seriously very pathetic experience ..for sweets its ok bt nt for food",0
City's place to hangout with family for snacks and sweets. Lot of variety and fresh sweets. Cakes are their speciality. Indian snacks north Indian south Indian. Name it and have it.  Full of crowd most of the time. Festival season like Diwali Rakhi lot of rush because quality is never compromised.,2
Pathetic Quality of food. Really disappointed,0

"Food is average. Mithaai is also okay, not so good, not so bad. Ambience is fine. Food quality is average. Their chaats and Raj Kachori - yummy.",1
Best sweet shop in tricity where you find all variety of sweets and snacks along with best quality. Certainly my go to place for any festive sweet shopping.,2
The sweets have the same pure taste since i was a kid. This place is my childhood,2
Well it's a standard pattern restaurant which has a sweet shop on the ground floor and the sit-in restaurant on the first floor. It is elderly friendly as it has a lift. But cleanliness needs more attention,1
"Not happy with the services of Anupam Sweets Sector 11, Panchkula.I ordered a 2 Allo tikki and one plate of Pau Bajji , at the time of ate 4 Pau my bajji is finished and I requested to one of waiter there for extra bajji as two paus are not not even touched. And when I asked staff he said extra bajji is chargeable and and when I said what I do with this paus he said 'Sir maat khayo' .This kind of service they offered.I ate bau bajji alone and bajji come in small size and salad come in big one.",0
"Experience was good, cold climate inside, every types of sweets available there, normal price, good packaging, very spacious parking space outside, cash & online payment accepted",2
"A good Restaurant for family ,  I visited Anupam since 2017 and they have variety of food .. Their staffs always behaves so politely. affordable price for thaali meals. I enjoyed always their tasty foods.",2

"High quality expensive sweets.  Few things like patties, etc, are reasonably priced.  You can buy 100 gms of quality sweets to taste, I did its great.",2
Good quality of food and service but so much crowd on weekend,2
"If you want to buy quality sweets and snacks in Panchkula, this location in sector 11 is a better option than Sindhi Sweets and Sagar Ratna, however they also have a less another outlet in MDC sec 5 which is not that good.
Overall, the meal is of decent quality and is priced at higher side",1
Don't know the food didn't seem as yum as it used to....went after a long gap though,1
The place was totally full .... Still the service was fast.... I ordered cholle bhature and coke combo for 130 which was really good üëå,2
"I visited with my friend, I liked it!! Food quality and ambiance is just awesome, We love to eat there, But prices are too much high.",2
"Strongly recommended! Every item served at this restaurant is simply outstanding with an irresistible twist to its taste. But the cakes, they are not just yummy, they are super yummy. A delightful blend of sweetness and love, these cakes are pure bliss. However, my all-time favorite remains the rich desi ghee motichoor laddu. This exemplary sweet, brimming with a delectable taste, renders me incapable of stopping myself from indulging. A true delight that leaves you craving for more. Do yourself a favor and visit this eatery, you won't regret it!",2
Very good ambience and good food quality always since many years. But recently taste of some items is coming down. Always loved their Veg Munchow soup taste in the past but this time first time the taste was not that good. They must remain careful to ensure quality and taste does not go down as that was always their USP.,2
There's always good food and good service there. I have been visiting them since 1997,2
Love the food... Always full of people try vegetable fried rice and pastries,2
"Recently visited here with my family.The place is known for chole-bhature so we ordered  the same along with some South Indian and North Indian food.To start with negatives first ,the preparation of dosa was not up to the mark and sambhar was tasteless .North Indian food was good and chole bhaturey was finger licking...",2
"Good food. Only problem is that sometimes,you have to wait long.",2
"Best sweet shop in Panchkula . Many variety of sweets, cake and pastry available here.",2
Good food but not worth the pricing,2
"This place lost its taste in food and sweets. We visited yesterday and had a very poor taste sponge rasgulla .:only sugar and water was added to it .Food quality also pathetic. We use to be a fan of this shop , however I will never visit this shop in my life . We complained to waiter and who informManager . The manager was so rude that he has not come to see us . Rather standing at reception and arrogant . Neither apology was tender not bill was reduced for very bad rasgulla. We also saw houseflies in the shop.",0
"Hair found twice in special thali, no compensation was made or exchanged, it was totally ignored.",0
I would give a minus ratings. Service is good but food quantity is below averageMasala dhokla is too sweet. There special thali has no taste. They serve cold sandwich and amarican toste. Totally waste of money. I have successfully wasted my money and time there. Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è,0
"Still the best in punchkula i visit it after 10 years gap although services are very good and its very busy specially in evening time and weekend days , dining area is very neat and clean and food is also good but a bit expensive side now a days overall welldone to their whole team.",2
Some sweets r not fresh nd very bad smelling in sweets,0

Amazing place with amazing veriety .definitely recommended,2
Food is good as always but service is bit slow,2
Nice place. Well mannered staff. Food was very tasty,2
Anupam sweets was my one of favourite restaurants of tricity but was disappointed with my last visit . On a rainy day I was not able to have paneer pakoras from here .. in fact that should be made fresh if someone order it . Kachori was not good . Hot coffee was too good.,1
Great quality of sweets and cakes they having different types if sweets and many more and there‚Äôs quality is also very nice,2
Very bad experience. I went there to buy 1 kg jalebi. I told the uncle to dont add the previous cooked jalebi. But after making the jalebi he added some previously cooked jalebi into bag. I confronted him and he started arguing with odd behaviour. So i immediately called the head and after discussion they gave me new cooked jalebi.Advice to customers: whenever you buy jalebi just see if they there is previously cooked jalebi coz they will add them and that can be as old as hour or so.,0
"Very good quality
Tasty sweets and snacks
Fully Hygienic maintained
Well behaved worker",2
The food quality here is really bad. My whole family got sick with food poisoning after eating here. Too much salt in manchurian which the restaurant hesitated to acknowledge as well. Might have been an Okay place to dine out in the past but quality has degraded terribly now,0
It was nice at every aspect. Must visit for dinner,2
"Nice Food, Nice Service...new dining hall is very good",2
I am an absolute dosa freak... And went wid my family for dinnerI tried their dosa... That too of 120/- and believe its quantity was really really godd... Even after a hard try... I couldn't complete it üòÖTaste was also good so... 4 stars to itüëçüëç,2
Great place to have a quick meal with good quality at affordable price. The place is good to sit with family as well as friends.,2
Nice place for family outing on leisure days. Sweets are good particularly Besan Cake.,2
"Be it snacks, sweets or restaurant services, everything is good. On the ground floor, you would have sweets and snacks takeaway counters. Staff is very cooperative and clean. If you want to have something there itself then you can visit the restaurant on the first floor. You have seniors who are with you and can't use stairs? No worries, lift is present for all seniors. :) There's plenty of well managed space in the restaurant to dine and enjoy food in different group sizes. They also have a separate kitty hall where you can plan your small parties. Food quality is really good. I had Dosa, and Lunch with my family and friends here. It was delicious. Everyone liked it. You must visit this place at least once.",2
Tasty food but  High price and low quantity,2
"A few days ago I had bought sweets worth ‚Çπ 880, paid through card but they took the amount of ‚Çπ 980, later I came to know after receiving the message. Complained to them today but neither did they return the money but they turned out to be very small hearted, I felt very bad by their behaviourü§î",0
We are visit today night 4 family dinner very bad experience about Anupam sweet they are serving old night dal makhani its smelling too much complaint to manager he is saying sir c rush so we are paying the bill and kulti from there......I request to all of u not going to anupam for dinner or lunch manazer are very cheap behaviour about food quality may be manazer will be  done a big lock üîí in shop anupam very shortly kehte hai na unchi dukan fika pakwan,0
"I tried many items like panipuri, phav bhaji, dhokla, fruit cake, malai kofta. All were tasty except malai kofta. Overall restaurant has good ambience but in weekend, waiting time is between 15-30 mins.",2
Good place to go with family and friends. On first floor there is restaurant which is very good. We can eat snacks and main course both here with reasonable price and quantity and quality. On ground floor there is sweets and bakery items available which is also good .,2
Great food and amazing customer service. They were on top of everything and very frequent re-fills on the bbq. Highly recommended for a high quality food and service in budget. Lunches and Dinner prices do vary and it might be a little extra for a cocktail drink.,2
"Just like name, it's pirated copy of BBQ Nation, the food is tasteless, most of the staff especially female looks too arrogant and untrained, Desert has a real desert of taste. Overall, it's a fish market with poorly planned and checked serviceVegetarian options: Very bad optionsParking: It's underground Mall parking",0
Overall it's an amazing buffet experience to try with family and friends. Their service was a bit clumsy but the staff was helpful. They even provide you with a complimentary cake to make your birthday more merrier. They have plenty of options in their starters and main course items to die for along with one complimentary drink. Their desserts are a must try.,2
"The pirates of grill has decreased their quality. The management is getting poor day by day. Delay in service, delay in getting required food, taste and many things affected the image brand. Table services has been decreased in few dishes as self service has been started. Main course was just fine, dessert again was challenging to accept that they still have a taste. Many dishes was under cooked. The floor was slippery, may be it was not getting cleaned correctly. I hope this kind of atmosphere must not be in their other franchise store.Vegetarian options: Have Vegetarians dishes too.Parking: Basement parking available. Some how difficult to get parking on weekends.",0
"Not a good place for vegetarian people, due to live grilling alot of food smell is in atmosphere,starter were fine, but not the live grill one champ paneer tikka & mashroom were flavour less, grilled pineapple is overrated as well.main course had 5 options but only had 1 paneer sabji option & that too were taste less.drinks were served just once only no unlimited drinks at all.Sweet dish had many options & eggless option as well thank God flavour were good too.But still for the price paid it's too overrated place with no veg food flavour.  Overall 3/5 i will rate them.",1
The problem with buffets is that they want to talk big but then they aren't able to deliver. This place is nice with AC and great sitting space. And the food is also great for first few rounds but if you keep on eating they will degrade the quality of food which they serve in each successive round. Also like in all buffets the main course is very bad. One better alternative for buffets can be that they maybe cut down on quantity but take their quality up.Still a great place to sit with your friends and lighten up.,1
Extremely bad customer service. I went to dine in for my birthday. At the entrance when I said table for two they mentioned it is occupied. I told there are 2 tables empty for which they said they are table for 4 people so we cannot give you.You have customer right in front of you but instead you want them to wait? Are you serious? I have visited other locations of Pirates as well never faced this issue.Here the table is clearly empty you can see it.,0
New year family dinner was done on 01.1.24 at 7.30 pm but food was average. Service was OK. Broken bowl . Taste of food was OK. Never recommend.,0
"The pirates of grill has decreased their quality. The management is getting poor day by day. Delay in service, delay in getting required food, they were serving brry delayed that we were sitting empty plates. Staff was spilling food on table while serving when asked to be careful they were like its okay not a big deal and stepped on foot of one of our friend and instead of saying sorry he was like its okay not a big deal this kind of behaviour is not appropriate. Staff used to be polite but they are more arrogant now as if serving food for free. Table services has been decreased in few dishes as self service has been started. Main course was just fine, dessert were also fine but didnt liked their attitude and management. Many dishes was under cooked.Vegetarian options: Will be worth for non vegetariansParking: Paid parking only",0
Good place for friends to celebrate üçæ. Place is noisy but food is good.  Service bit slow but staff courteous.They charge half for kids below 8 years and first drink is complimentary.Good place for food after tiring shopping sphere.Happy eating üòã,2
The starters are elaborate in numbers . The main course and the desserts are laid on the buffer table and to top it all both are un limited . The sitting is comfortable with good rush and clientele at all times . The service staff can be more effective and more effectively responsive to clients demands and this is one point of improvement to be focused on by the management.. Being placed in Elante Mall helps in making the Pirates of the Grill very accessible to all . Definitely recommended for food lovers . Keep Pirating .Vegetarian options: Good range of vegetarian optionsParking: Both paid valet and paid underground parking available in plenty .Kid-friendliness: Very kids friendly interior sitting,2
"A total let down..Service was very slow and the person serving was repeatedly asking us if he should bring more starters, even though the restaurant has an 'all you can eat'  policy.Next, they didn't have grilled fish for starters. This was a surprise since all its competitors have this and it is very common. Have been to other similar barbeque restaurants in various cities and fish always forms one of the starter items.Other than the above, the food was good.Vegetarian options: Available",0
"One of the satisfactory buffet restaurants in Tricity. From starters to the main course to the final destination,  desserts everything was mouth-watering. Additionally, you can get drinks on request from the captain.Enjoy! ü•Ç",2
"We had vegetarian lunch buffet. They started with grilled snacks on the table, dimsums and pani puri were also there. One drink is included with the buffet. We had virgin mojito which was really nice. Soup had one option for vegetarian and other was non vegetarian. Lots and lots of options for main course and desserts. We were so so full. Would recommend go to this place with just a light breakfast and you will be glad.Vegetarian options: They have plenty of vegetarian options in everything from starters to main course and desserts.",2
"Pirates of grill is superb for outside buffets, Price for per person is Rs. 1000, So you must be in for eating and must be a foody.Desserts are good, Food is good..",2
"This is the place for foodies. This is situated in elante mall in Chandigarh. If you like  non vegetarian and vegetarian food comprises of wide variety of snacks, followed by main course and then good variety of sweet dishes , you should visit this place. You have to pay per plate and then you can enjoy unlimited food. Food is complimented with one drink, you can choose from cold drink, ice tea, fresh lime or king fisher beer. Though variety of drinks hard and cocktails are available but they are quite costly.Sitting arrangement is spacious and comfortable. Enjoy food with your family and friends.",2
"Food was great, great staff @
& varieties A+, taste , presentation was nice",2
"Best for people who love non veg more.. crispy corn, pineapple, momos are the best.",2
The food is delicious. All varieties are available. It's a must visit.,2
"Buffet style, all you can eat @1k per person for vegetarian, and 1.5 k for non vegetarian. The food is excellent and the deserts even better. Wide vary of of both. Starters however steal the show with the grill right on your table. Amazing experience with friends and family.",2
"Everything is good! Food and service! However, the man standing on the door is too rude Ankit Tyagi!! Worst service given by him he doesn't knw how to talk to women esp! He actually told me will serve veg food on plate then where is the concept of grill gone! He could not change the table so he was too rude n nasty!! I would like to inform RAJESH the other guy I guess even he is of the same position is amazing he knws what cx  service is all about such a pleasing personality.. just cuz of Ankit i am giving 4 rest all stars for Rajesh and team",2
"We went there for a corporate team party. We were around 12-15 people. Their starters are good but could be improve. At some point of time, I feel like their staff is very busy in serving food. If I am asking something, they are not even listening. I was denying for some starter but the person had served me forcefully. üòèüòèI don't like that attitude and while serving they were in such a hurry. I don't know why.Other than that they have good staff. Starters were good.Food was more delicious than starters. Overall experience was good but their prices are bit at higher side.Other than this, lots of variety was there in non veg items. Which is good for non veg eater's.",1
"Friendly but highly disorganized staff. I placed an order, and they sent me the bill ‚Äî this happened on two separate occasions. Limited menu options considering what they are charging. While some items on the menu were good, others were not up to par. In short, not planning on visiting them anytime soon.",1
My favourite grillery as it satiates my tastebuds in a good value of money.Must visit if:1. You love good food2. In affordable price( There are some early check-in hours too)3. If you seek for variety4. If you love grilled snacks,2
Food really good staff and best for family dinner. Little Space issue but they're organize well everything and maintained the taste food timely staff surf you food appreciate. Highly Recommend,2
"Best place in Trichy for food. The food is super tasty. The service is super fast. There are lot of varitey in food.
You can get the buffet arround 850 per pax. You gonna love it.
I have been to this place almost 10 times and still not bored of this place.",2
"Terrible experience. Not only did they ask us to leave after just 2 hours, but they also failed to provide separate grills for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Zero stars for such poor hospitality and service.",0
"I visited this place two days back.  Overall my experience was mixed.  I can called it average.  Few food items are good especially in snacks but main course was not good.   Sweets are really poor.  If I compare it with Barbeque nation, pirates need very hard work to compete them.The best for pirates are that they are sitting in one of the best mall.  Footfall is heavy because of that.",1
"Very good experience food was very yummy and the staff was very kind and helpful We went to special family dinner. i really like chilly garlic mushroom and matar mushroom and kadahii paneer in main course bread are as usual expensive similar to other restaurantHighly recommended. The best way to judge a restaurant's kitchen is to see it and the restaurants that have kitchens you can see into like Punjab Grill, really impress me because it shows the confidence the chefs have in their hygiene, their system and their preparations!",2
"We went at this place to celebrate the birthday.We were two vegetarians and two non vegetarians.Like happened with everyone we were almost full in snacks as they have wide variety of snacks.In snacks we had mushroom, paneer tikka, grilled pineapple, kabab, sweet corns etc.Their grilled pineapple is just mouth luscious.Non veg people loved their non veg items. They are fully satisfied with their taste.After that we moved towards the main course and deserts. They are also yummy.Apart from these we also had LIIT. Its awesome.",2
"Food is awesome, but their waiter always deny for food which is on demand. Specially mutton, fish and in chicken leg pieces. In complementary bear is included, but they don't tell you and if you came to know then only they will provide you bear. So they are charging more, but not serving with true heart. Not all staff like this, some offer good food and services.",2
This restaurant was really nice and pleasant until we found mouse in the restaurant on cooking shelf during billing which was really horrible and disgusting. Although the food was good lots of variety in main course and starters. Service was very poor and slow. If you ask any waiter for assistance they‚Äôll just ignore you and even if they listen by any chance they‚Äôll take forever to make that happen.,0
"The food is delicious, you would not feel like leaving anything. The spread is also fine. I never end up having the main course. And the sweet dishes list is also extravagant.The only thing lacking is the service which is extremely slow.But all in all this place is a must visit.",2
You can eat everything available in 1k only with awesome taste.There is a buffet system in pirates for veg and non veg persons.,2
"Great place for foodies! Mostly crowded.Liked everything, except momos.In the grill section, they serve - prawns, chicken and Seekh kebab. More items/flavors could be added.I liked prawns the most!Chicken momos were bit off.I have been to GT road n this place within a short interval, so I think I can do fair comparison. Don't want to downplay this place, but I feel GT has more variety of food than pirates. Taste wise both places are excellent!",2
"Today I visited ""pirates of grill"" To celebrate a family members birthday... We really had an amazing experience. Even though the menu lacked quantity when compared to other buffet places like gt road, barbecue nation etc, but I assure you that the items they DO have are totally top notch!!!Quantity : 4‚≠êTaste : 5‚≠êCustomer service : 5‚≠êAmbience : 5‚≠êCleanliness : 5‚≠êCovid precautions : 5‚≠êIn short, totally worth visting with your family or friends. Though a bit on the expensive side, the taste, ambience, staff behavior makes up of it.Signing offSatvik Kamboj‚úåüèª",2
"Pretty average in everything. They are not customer oriented. The executive who showed the table had no manners how to recieve guests and they have restrictions for time i.e. 2hr. And in that time their service is too slow. From 10 minutes am still waiting for starters to repeat that too when its not fully occupied.  Food taste is average. Not recommended,  no courtesy like their competitors.  Its like ""rebok nahi toh reboke sahi"".Vegetarian options: Limited service.  Too slow to serve pineappleDietary restrictions: 2hour time limit.",0
"This is best place to have non-veg buffet including  both l non-veg cuisines and licious desserts. It will cost less than 1100 per person. Check out few pics uploaded by me for your reference.
Have a nice meal üç¥üç±",2
"Best buffet and starters are nicely presented even the system of grill are been their in table over which we can take feel of grilling starters like paneer tikka, mushrooms, and soyachap. There they provide with complimentary drinks hence good choice under 1000 rupees.",2
Agar mere pass joota marne ka option ho toh me wha gate per khade 2 bando ko wohi maru.. they told me to wait for 20-25 minute after table booking but its 12hrs now.. no call from them very poor service of attending people..,0
Head for a wonderful experience! Scrumptiously delicious delicacies!! Starters are a 10/10. Maine course is wonderful and desserts are beyond awesome! I'll place them in the irresistible category!Special: cinnamon pineapple that they serve on swords!I hope no one dies of over eating! You'll come out happier!,2
"Veg, non-veg all grilled are available here, indian main course is average but baked sweet items are amazing,located at perfect place at elante mall chandigarh. Place is generally packed , ambience is superb over all ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è rating for this one.",2
"Good place for food lovers . Non-veg and vegetarian options with complimentary drink during lunch time .But when last visited, found service is very slow and not much options available like in earlier days used to be with much more options.",1
"I m never going there again. It was 25th dec and i went there with a friend of mine and it had been 50 mins sitting there. We were enjoying our time and having fun when the manager came and brought us the bill. He asked us to pay, we were in the middle of eating our meal. I asked them to wait but they persisted and stood there until I got up and paid the bill. Then I got back to my meal and after 15 mins when I finished the meal and stood up for some dessert the manager came and started yelling at us to get out now since its been an hour. His exact words ‚Äúwe are showing you respect and you are making it hard to do that, others are waiting in line so please get up and go if you have eaten enough already‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt waana create a scene so me and my friend got up and left the place. Note- Never pay your bill before you are done eating even if they stand there and persist on it. I would like Pirates of the grill to please train there staff better. Just to accomodate 2 new customers they lost their 8 years old loyal customers. I prefer bbq nation now.",0
"Good ambiance, Genuine Price, Friendly Staff, But no reservations. First come first reserve. Food is tasty. Precautions taken for Covid.
We celebrate my sister's birthday here and it was good experience at Pirates of Grill.
Yummilicious üòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",2
Experience was good but service was slow. I came with my husband and brothers. Everytime I had to ask for thrice for everything. It made me irritated. Food taste was good.,2
Heard about the place so went to tryWas dere on weekdays for dinner just to avoid weekends rush and crowdCharges were 1000per buffet no alacat accept drinksOverall found lot of varieties service by staff is gud and staff cohabitate so ambiance was goodOverall quality of meal was just okay for me found below average can be betterBut like dere panipuri thing and couple tandoor startersBut rest of stuff just one try  but not recommended,1
"First time visit, it was a good experience.They serve buffet at 685 for veg and 800 for non-veg.Starter was delicious, coming to main course it was not as expected, and last the dessert were amazing. As they have verity of deserts.Overall a fabulous experience ... Enjoyed a lot with my friends.",2
"Food is good but the place is insanely noisy! You can go and have food there but hardly talk to each other or have a cosy time. Staff is polite and listen to your specific needs and try to fulfill those, which is great.",2
"The food was good but there was a cockroach on our table. At the dessert counter, there was another bug on one of the cakes. Filthy. Used to be a top choice for us but will probably not be going again.",0
"Nice ambience, long wait once you are inside things are more aligned. Served with nice starter both options veg and non veg‚Ä¶Once you are done with starters that are served on table you have to move to grab the buffet. Great options lacks bit taste as compared to starter.. one drink was complimentary however the size is small.. can do better in terms of main course taste .. and in sweet dish great range available.. overall one timer if you love trying food with flavour if you are a eater then go and much as many time",2
What makes this place unique is BBQ with buffet with great ambience . The variety of food offered is great plus they don't compromise on quality. I loved each and every food item from starters to main course to desserts. it's a must try place.,2
Great place. Wonderful experience.  Similar to Bar -be -Que. Snacks are wonderful and believe me you will love to skip main course and have only snacks. Grilled snacks with mock tails. Variety is goos. Deserts too are good with lots of variety. Ambiance is wonderful. A good place to enjoy.,2
"Overall, the place is great. Tasty starters, hospitable staff and comfortable ambience.However, the main course is not the best. I tried kadhi and karela both were good but could be more flavourful.The highlight for me was service. I went there by myself but still the service wasn‚Äôt lacking. Everyone smiles, pays attention and the manager kept asking me if I need anything else.",2
I am very happy that I visited this place on the occasion of my friends engagement celebration. We reach at 7:28pm and while I was enquiring for the price that how much it cost for our buffet they said that till 7:30 pm we have early bird and the price of buffet will be sort of less then entering after 7:30 pm we instantly entered the place and ordered 4 non veg dinner and the price of that was 800 Rupees per and I can not complain this price as i was whole time comparing this with barbeque nation and every time Pirates of grill was better now come to food it was deliciously awesome really I have tested many of the restaurant and all but i really liked this that's why i am writing this much of line. now they have a singer also who sang some great song and one for our friends too and they gave us a cake and the cake was also great and as you can not eat that cake there as your tummy already surrender by the great food they will pack your cake in a very good manner that you will not shame taking home. now they charges extra 4% service charge I think this was not the case with barbeque nation but i was fine with it it was written on the table menu also so no hidden thing i will attach the receipt you can see that also with this you can get the number and address for the Pirates of grill.so overall must to have. one single thing it remains bit crowded so if you want to have peace then try to go on week days. Thanks,2
It never disappoints. Best Barbecue restaurant in Chandigarh by miles. I must say value for money as well. They service with smile and food served is of great taste and quality.,2
We were so excited to have dinner at this place but it was the worst experience we had tonight.... food taste was we never expected üòûüòû not a single item was good in taste üòï i think it is a total waste of money and it's a big no for next time....,0
This is a great place to have some food with family,2
"You know when you are hungry and can eat crazy , this is the place to hop in for good food. Service is good, little slow for the prawn I guess , haha but rest is good. Though I always love the snacks more than food. The waiting time is high so I advice booking ur table 30 minutes in advance. Awesome staff and peeps !",2
"Very good experience for buffet dinning. Variety of options for Veg and no veg lovers with Indian, continental etc. options to explore with full Bar service. Food tastes good and ambiance is very comforting. Good venue for private and group parties within Elante Mall. Found the layout of the restaurant not ideal with food serving area a bit cramped. Overall experience was good as expected !!!",2
"Had to give 5 stars.Really amazing food. Not a single dish was average.The best service I‚Äôve ever experienced in a buffet restaurant. Aman Kumar was really helpful and cheerful.Atmosphere though was a bit congested and smoky. Definitely not very airy.But all in all, 4.7/5",2
Great option of starters and main course. Very friendly staff. Went their for my mother's birthday. They tried to make it extra special with singing and yummm chocolate cake.,2
"Here vibe is awesome specially during weekend time But day by day they are increasing their price and nothing kind of new add on had been seen yet,every day same Menu is kept there and just 2 desserts are added.And service is not that much good because most of the waiters Delays the Starter time and i had faced around 20 minutes delay in starter.I hope they improve it in future whatever i wrote about.",2
Nice place.. great food.. love the varieties served.. food is really tasty. There are lot of varieties in both veg and non-veg.. the desserts are also available in lot of varieties..,2
"I went there to give my birthday treat. The ambience is very good with Light music. All starters are good. This is not the first time I visited but the recent times, they served a bunch of some extra new starters which I didn't expected and were amazing as others. These places are meant for people having a good appetite. You won't stop eating.We mainly had starters and then went straight for the deserts. I guess no one would keep a space for the main course.",2
"Quality of Snacks nd food has degraded, options in desserts not great.Service has got even poor. Staff is not welcoming and Hospitality is not upto the standards.Lagging in Buffet Competetion",2
"We went for the non veg buffet which was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was good too. Tldr: The food was delicious, and their were many options to choose from including the desert. I did see a small cockroach below the grill under our table, other than that it was a pleasant experience :)",1
"The place is amezing... great experience
Tasty food ..nice service",2
The food is excellent and the deserts even better. Wide vary of of both. Starters however steal the show with the grill right on your table. Amazing experience with friends and family.,2
Sea food üç≤üç≤ was to yummy tasty. buffet was good all over food delicious..seating arrangement was good.but service was little bit late,2
"I have visited Ellante Pirates of the Grill with my family on last Saturday.  We were let down by their quality of non veg food. They charge you Rs 1100 per person, but the quality was worse. All of our stomach were upset after eating their food. I had worst experience . Will never ever visit any of their restaurants again.",0
Love the food the prawns are one thing that pulls me to this place. Also others are chicken dimsums and sweet dishes and the Amritsari fish üòãüòã,2
"Food is okayish. You‚Äôll get similar or even better tasting food in BBN or Abs Bbq, but Pirates‚Äô quantity is less - they give 2 prawns per barbecue stick, as opposed to the industry standard of 3. Their staff is the worst - not in terms of politeness (coz they are polite), but rather in terms of offering food - their priority is to get you stop eating starters as fast as possible, unlike BBN or Abs BBQ. Pirates‚Äô staff don‚Äôt offer you any starter more than once by themselves and then they ask you which one to repeat, and after sometime, instead of asking ‚Äúwhat else to bring?‚Äù, they ask you ‚Äúshould we take the bbq away?‚Äù. And this is not one single staff - it‚Äôs the majority of them. And more importantly, this behavior has repeated multiple times that i have visited this place. And that‚Äôs precisely the reason why I prefer BBN or Abs BBQ. I think the management instructed the staff to behave like that, because usually in other similar restaurants, the staff behavior is just a reflection of the instructions that trickle down from the top level. And it‚Äôs also evident in the quantity of food per serving - like the prawns example I mentioned above. Even they keep two pieces of chicken per serving of the barbecue stick. But in terms of price of buffet, it charges you no less than what BBN or Abs BBQ charges you - thereby making its name ‚ÄúPirate‚Äù to be literally meaningful! Not coming back here anymore.",0
"Veg buffet Cost around ‚Çπ1050.
Expansive buffet with almost average taste, wastage of money & time.",0
Best place in town to have lunch and dinner if you lookin for a buffet ambiance is nice tried both veg n non veg options r equally good loved the snacks perfectly to enjoy with drinks n the main course as well üëåüëålots of variety of sweets too n all were amazing üòãüòãMust visit if you around üç¥‚úåÔ∏èTaste 4/5value for money 4.5/5,2
"A great competitor of Barbeque Nation, Great Service, Large variety and awesome taste... downside ??Unlike BBQ Nation, when they are crowded, they@ don't much care about the customers, their service slows down and you have to literally raise your voice for things to be served on table.Well,the menu is a huge spread of indian, continental, mediterranean & chinese dishes, with wonderful starters and lavish dessert types.Their off grill starters are much more interesting than ON Grill, since they don't have much on Grill.Place is compact and they serve almost 70-80 customers altogether.Anyways, a great place to be tried at least once a month :)",2
Food served is cold as grill is also not so hot . In snacks I like only roasted pineapple which is very good else all food served is cold. But main course dish in non veg is very good. Again there laccha parantha is not so good. But employees are very good at service. But I don't think after paying aprrox 1200Rs buffet we deserve cold food.,0
"A nice place to enjoy buffet.  The ambience is good, but the service i felt is too slow.  The food is awsome, specially the dessert section.",2
"Loved the place, was a bit pricey, but the food was good, it's like very suitable for once a year celebration for middle class families, a good experience if you want to spend money, 1000 about per person if you have starters and buffet, different if you order something else, but yes the food is awesome and I'll definitely recommend you to go for atleast once in a lifetime experience",2
"Service was very poor , The quality of snacks served on the grill was not good  and it's a bit congested place . Overall a waste of money. The only advantage is it's inside elante mall .
A big No .",0
"Its was a great experience in here. If you have your friends or with family this the place where you can hang out. Nice good with good services.
I love this place and its food.",2
Pirates of grill best place for food lover....but there was a issue we got hair in crispy corn....at the same time we call manager he feel sorry for that ..but naturally its not happened in such a reputed restro...manager give a sorry cake to us  as a complimentry....enjoy the food,2
"In India, we have two giants of food restaurants serving buffet. BBN and POG. I always loved POG more. We head out to have dinner at this place which turned out to be a good experience. The food quality is really nice especially the baked pineapple and they way they serve is interesting. The crispy corns was yum. We also get to hear a very good vocalist. Pasta is very cheesy just the way I prefer. I loved their coconut pie which was really mind blowing in taste. I would love to check out the place again. I",2
"Pirates of Grill is a great place. Overall experience here was v nice. Live music does add to the great experience. Snacks and all other items are very good. The ""pirates"" help in the best way they can fulfilling the needs. Definitely a place for you all to visit. They celebrate the birthday and anniversaries as well for you. Overall full marks to them. Cheers.",2
"All starters are good, many varieties, can be customised as per your preferences. Main course and deserts are also very good. Serving is excellent and always helpful and serves which asked on request.",2
The ambience of this place was quiet great... There was live music... The staff was quick and very friendly... The food was a lot better compared to the VR Punjab's Pirates of Grill ( it's really tasty).,2
"I just love the way how they serve,Lot of variety in starter only -leads to skip main course.Crispy corn and chaap is just superb.Service is very quick and sharp.Must try mojito..",2
They never pick the call for table booking.,2
"A good restaurant chain. You can get a buffet and enjoy unlimited items on the buffet. The service is not so fast in rush hours.Vegetarian options: Apart from non veg options, there is a variety of veg items where vegetarians can also eat.",2
"Poor very poor, i suggest instead of this try barbeque for buffet and ASOD, here no cleaning, no variety of food, no drinks in buffet, even water bottle not provide. Waste of time and money",0
"It's a wonderful place to spend time with your family, loved ones and your friends. Awesome buffet and the staff is also very helpful. Overall a 5 star experience. We had a lot of fun. You can have a great time here if your pocket has no problem üòÖWe had the dinner buffet 4 non veg and 2 veg and got a bill of ‚Çπ5700 .",2
"Poor experience, rude staffThey don‚Äôt mention the age for Child on their Menu or anywhere  and then say for 8 year olds they want to charge the whole Adult Buffet prices ( while we try to enter ).I mean how on earth a child of age 8 will be able to eat same as an Adult , why will I pay a 1000 plus for my kid !!",0
"Visited this place n number of time but this time had worst experience ever. One manager over here, MR Shridar pandey was very rude person.They way the talk was pathetic.Also requested for one food item so many time but get that after 30 min.",0
I love this place. Ate alot of chicken and sweets. Had great time with my best friends. Love it. Thanks pirots of grills‚ù§,2
"First visit,. Starters were good.Main course was fine not so happening. Sweet dish options were good . Surely visit and see everyone,s taste is never same üòä",1
If we make a comparison with their competitor in market then Barbeque Nation is far better than them.,1

It was a great experience here. Food is also yummy,2
"Pirates of Grill is an exceptional eatery that offers an amazing dining experience in Chandigarh. The restaurant's interior is cozy and charming, with beautiful decor that creates a fun and lively atmosphere. The menu features a variety of dishes, from local specialties to other popular cuisines, all prepared with fresh and high-quality ingredients. The highlight of the restaurant is their unique concept of unlimited grilling, where guests can select their favorite meats, seafood, and vegetables and have them grilled to perfection right at their table. The staff is friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist guests with anything they need, ensuring a hassle-free and enjoyable experience. The restaurant's rooftop seating area also offers a stunning view of the city, making it a perfect spot for a relaxed meal with friends or family. Overall, Pirates of Grill is a must-visit for anyone looking for excellent food and a great atmosphere in Chandigarh. Highly recommended!",2
"Fine ambiance,  good food. Bit busy on public holidays.  Avoid visiting on public holidays the food quality gets compromised also the staff is in hurry at that time. Overall a good experience.",2
"Very normal buffet menu, variety is quite less considering the price they are charging 940rs for a lunch non veg buffet, service is also slow despite being scarcely crowded",1
Manager named sridhar pandey was very rude when asked for bill. Ridiculous behaviour shown by him. Will never visit pirates of grill again in future.,0
"Good place, food has improved drastically
Loved the dumplings",2
"Recently visited this place again it was nice but service is slow. In any buffet, it was first time I found the main course was quite good. üëç",2
Good taste for almost all menus...great ambience too...but Music was too loud... couldn't even hear what my neighbor is speaking,2
It's always best for all categories. I had visited with my family for lunch and we all enjoyed the food and ambience. Kids were also satisfied with the food options for them.,2
Good value for money taking into consideration their vast variety and good quality of dishes.Snacks(veg): 7/10Snacks(non-veg):9/10Main course (both veg and non-veg):8/10Dessert: 10/10,2
"We'd pre-booked for International Women's Day. Good ambiance, lot of starters, lovely main course (buffet) and great desserts.  Unlimited mocktails. Bar attached. Non-Veg as well as Veg options. Prompt service. Courteous staff. Reasonable prices. Will visit again.",2
"Awesome place, ambience, starters -- Good Food & deserts -- Live Music -- Service is not good - Worth the Price.",2
"One of the finest buffet offerings in tricity. Love their  snacks, main course and desserts. Even their drinks (mocktails) are drool worthy. They constantly add new items to their desserts which is a plus point. Location-wise they are situated in the most hip mall in Chandigarh- Elante Mall so the crowd is always good. Easily accessible and wheelchair friendly, though it's always wise to call beforehand and make them aware of any such requirements. Good service by trained and professional staff. Now they serve dumplings and dahi golgappas as well. Yay..way to go guys. Good place to have a great time and meal with friends and family. Pro-tip: Always call before hand to get your table reserved to beat the waiting lines. No reservations on weekends.In post pandemic scenario, they have ensured a host of safety measures like temperature check and ensured availability of sanitizer. Now everything is brought to the table by service staff wearing masks.",2
Starters are amazing. Crispy corn was really gud but main course was pathetic not worth a penny. Desserts were ok but limited they can increase more options in desserts. Service charge was charged two times in the bill. Please study the bill before paying.,1
"The service was very good and well mannered, the starters and deserets were excellent but the main food was eatable but not upto the mark. The main food needs to be improved rest everything is fine, good variety of foods both veg and non veg like many different types of desert. I really enjoyed starters and deserts.‚≠êÔ∏èBonus‚≠êÔ∏è: If you want some good discount just use zomato or swingy for both booking and payment.",1
"My recent visit to Barbeque Nation left me with mixed feelings, and I must say it didn't quite live up to my expectations. In essence, I've dined at other places, like GT Road, where I enjoyed a better buffet experience in terms of taste, variety, and affordability.However, it's essential to note that if you're visiting Barbeque Nation solely for its brand reputation, it might offer a different appeal.One aspect I genuinely appreciated was the attentive service. Each table had a dedicated server who went out of their way to accommodate our requests. They even recommended trying new dishes and were open to feedback, promptly relaying it to the chef.Now, let's delve into the culinary experience. While some dishes were undoubtedly delicious, there was inconsistency. Some items were overcooked, and the overall taste fell below my expectations. Surprisingly, there were no complimentary beverage options like coke or lime juice; instead, they encouraged guests to purchase drinks from their menu.The live counters lacked the liveliness and interaction I've come to expect during buffets, especially on a Friday evening. Most of the time, I found myself having to request dishes from our dedicated server. Desserts were generally disappointing, and many of the main course offerings were served at a less-than-ideal temperature.To add to the frustration, locating soup bowls proved to be a challenge, and I had to make do with regular dinner plates for my soup. These seemingly minor details added up to a less enjoyable dining experience.All in all, it feels like Barbeque Nation is resting on its laurels and relying on its brand name to justify premium pricing. However, when it comes to the actual dining experience, there are better buffet options available.Honestly, I don't see myself returning to Barbeque Nation anytime soon.",1
"This is one of the best options if you want to eat a buffet and a lot of non veg and veg snacks, including sea food like fish and prawns.  Vegetarian snacks and buffet are also available.  Service is good. The snacks served hot and kept on charcoal fire in front of you on the table so that you could enjoy piping hot snacks.  Good experience with family.Parking: Sector 26 madhya marg main",2
"I absolutely loved the experience of being at BBQ Nation. Being a regular visitor i have never been disappointed. The service,staff and food all were up to the mark. Mr Suraj provided great service and took care of all the needs like food taste etc. He is truly a great asset to the bbq nation not just an employee. Hope to visit soon. Keep it up guys. Special thanks to Mr Suraj who's been always on his toes to serve better. And yes I loved the prawns most. Thank you chef for them",2
"Barbeque Nation chandigarh is a must-visit  place for foodies and barbecue enthusiasts. The restaurant offers a wide variety of grilled dishes, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, all cooked to perfection. It's perfect for those times when you crave a buffet but don't want to leave the house. The only thing I didn't like was the absence of stickers on each box to check its contents. By the time you open and check, everything gets cold. Other than that, the concept is great. It claims to be perfect for 2-3 people, but it was enough for our family of 4. Overall, it was a great experience enjoying a buffet at home.",2
"We had a wonderful  time with good food and gossip . The staff was amazing, and the service  was good.",2
"It was a great experience. Went there for dinner.
They do not give mandatory juice so 4 stars for that.",2

Very nice ambience .Vegetarian options: Lots of veg option available including nice selection of gol gappa and chats.Kid-friendliness: Kids will love itWheelchair accessibility: Yes it is wheel chair accessible",2
Recently visited Barbeque nation Sector-26 and really surprised to the downfall of service and good quality . Barbeque nation has always been my favourite but never saw a Barbeque with such limited dinner Buffet Veg menu .,0
"I ordered the barbecue in a box (non-veg), which included 6 snacks, 4 main courses, and 3 dessert items along with dips, salad and salan. From the packaging to the taste, everything was perfect. It gave me the feeling of a buffet in the comfort of my home. It's perfect for those times when you crave a buffet but don't want to leave the house. The only thing I didn't like was the absence of stickers on each box to check its contents. By the time you open and check, everything gets cold. Other than that, the concept is great. It claims to be perfect for 2-3 people, but it was enough for our family of 4. Overall, it was a great experience enjoying a buffet at home.",2
"Overall bad experience, recently visited this place, in one word it was disgusting,Think twice while visiting this place,Interior of place was in bad shape and food was unhygienic, found hair in veg biryani and on complaining to staff instead of they should sorry for that staff is arguing with us. One more thing at the time of booking we had mentioned that one person is having food allergies and we had mentioned the allergies to the restaurant manager in advance but they had not prepared a single dish for that person.Uneducated staff who not even want to listen to the customer. If you zoom these pictures of biryani you will clearly find a hair in it.Overpriced for veg and main course had very less options.",0
The quality is not like a restaurant. They do not have chef might be just cook like street vendor. Service is very poor.. it was good few years ago but really bad in quality. Not a recommended.. I think go to others such as GT road and pirate of grill rather than spending and spoiling your memorable day here‚Ä¶,1
Hidden gem in chandigarh.  It is great for both veg and non veg..Sea food is excellentVegetarian options: Add more leafy,2
"Great experience! While thinking about delicious food, the first restaurant that comes to mind is Barbeque Nation. One can have a delightful lunch or dinner at this restaurant. The ambience is good. High chairs are available here. It's the perfect place to visit with family and friends to dine in. The most amazing thing is its buffet. One can eat anything by purchasing its buffet package. Both kinds of buffets are available: vegetarian and non-vegetarian. A myriad number of options are provided in start-ups such as panner tikka, veg sea kabab, roasted corns, golgappe, Manchuria etc. Then, various kinds of vegetables are there such as butter naan, butter roti, kdahi paneer, Shahi paneer, mix-veg, butter chicken etc. One can enjoy live music.",2
"Good vibes. Staff behaviour is also good. Sometimes you have to compromise with varieties because their menu keeps changing few things like they are not serving chicken leg piece all the time. They are serving chicken wings instead, said by staff. Birthday complementary cake with clapping of staff members win your hearts.",2
"Great Experience! The service was super efficient  friendly and kind...the tandoori non vegetable was delicious...the prawns, the fish , the chicken   the salads, the main course and dessert, we even could have a bottle of red Sula wine at a very reasonable price. We even had a big discount for happy Friday!",2
"The place is located in sector 26 and the buffet is awesome. The snacks are a huge variety served. Chat papdi, tikki, malai chap ,masala chaap, crispy corn, honey chilli cauliflower, boiled corn, pineapple  roasted, mushroom tikka, paneer tikka, kabab and many more . These are vegetarian options. Then in the main course there are ample things like dal  makhni, biryani vegetable, paneer, aloo gobhi, mix veg , methi malai matar and all types of bread.The dessert counter also has a plethora of yummy things like faluda kulfi, simple kulfi in 4-5 variety , pastries, custurd, kheer, gulab jamun,moong dal ka halwa,fruits like water melon and melons,And yes the staff is so so courteous and cooperative.Must visit with family and friends",2
"BBQ Nation‚Äôs ambiance is perfect for celebrations, family gatherings, and friendly get-togethers. The lively atmosphere and the joy of shared grilling make it an ideal place to bond over good food and conversations.",2
I went there yesterday and the first thing which was informed after stepping in was that you have only 1 hour to enjoy half our for snacks and then half for meal.This is for the first time i heard anything from the staff as i have been visiting this from last 3+ years. Food quality was good though but it could have been better.The only that i didn't liked was the timeframe how can you expect someone to eat that fast there was a time when you visit them and can enjoy your meal at your own pace. Will think twice before going there again.Thanks,0
"I had a pleasant experience. The food was average. Neither too good nor too bad. The staff were all too kind and well mannered. The ambience would have been perfect, but the music was a little too loud for my taste. Else, I had a pleasant time.",2
"Following are my observations:1. The restaurant was quite clean. But the maintenance of seats was on the lower end. The seats have gone old and torn off.2. The staff is very welcoming, amicable and cooperative. Also, with good know how.3. Rest of the Food was good but saag tasted the worst. I would suggest them to improve it or just don‚Äôt make it coz they destroyed the most authentic and delicious delicacy of Punjab.4. Restrooms could have been more clean and hygienic with better facilities and basic amenities.5. Place needs to party up. I don‚Äôt know, something was messing. May be the restaurant needs some sort of renovation and creativity.Overall the experience was all right.",2
"BBQ CHD is a place that can be enjoyed with anyone from kids to friends or from family to colleagues. It's name is enough. Food is awesome  here though with time some modifications or additions in menu is required. The menu is now aged a bit. Ambiance is nice but washroom is not properly managed. Service is good and fast. Sweet dish menu is large and sweet dish items are yummy, it is really difficult to taste all the sweet dishes as one felt full at that time. Dishes in main course are tasty and there is variety in this also. As far as snacks are concerned it's their speciality and it's really delicious, specifically for non veg snacks.",2
"I went to barbeque sector 26 with my family. But this time very disappointed with the service. Snacks are good so as service. But when you go to eat 1st half of the items are empty no one care to fill it up when I requested it refilled after good 15 minutes garlic noodles were pathetic too oily and tasteless. In the sweet section it will not refilled after requested 2-3 times like phirni, jelly etc.ProsInterior is good.Snacks are good.ConsOn the eating and sweet section no one care to refill it.",1
"Just like other Barbeque outlets, amazing experience once again. Staff was very good and polite. We stayed for 2 hrs and 30min and filled ourselvesüòÇ. Starters were good especially crispy corn and pineapple. For veg starters, there is paneer tikka, golgappe , pasta, other variety of tikka etc. For non-veg starters there is prawns, leg piece, fish etc. We ate sweets very much especially brownie and kulfi. We tried almost every kulfi. Stomach was full still we had lunch. We had garlic naan, butter naan and lachha paratha and different dishes like butter chicken, dal makhani , paneer butter masala. Food was awesome. It costed us 681 per person because of student id. Must visit place",2
"The food is okay to good, depending on the item in question. The main course is commoditized. The snacks are better. You have to ask them to make it non-spicy in case you are allergic to or dislike spicy food.They illegaly charge a 5% Service Charge in the final invoice. Not only is it an unfair trade practice but also illegal in India.+++Edit: after contacting their customer service per their reply to my comment, they simply said:Dear Guest,Service charges go towards supporting the entire restaurant staff.+++I will likely file a complaint with Consumer Grievance Commission to report the illegal activity.",0
"Well i have been frequent to this place since my childhood i love the food this place is all about the food the taste varies from person to person but the service has always been great especially the recent exotic menu there is rabbit , squid, octopus what not must try once rest it has different than whats usual rest and don't fill up on snacks there much more to it",2
"Visited this outlet after eons and expectedly, it didn‚Äôt disappoint me at all. Barbeque nation spells fun, fervour and delicious food and that‚Äôs exactly what a customer wants when visiting them! I was quite impressed by the innate attention and courtesy doled out by the staff in equal rigour as they present their unique culinary experience dancing their way into your hearts!Recently there was an African food festival occurring when I did visit, so the entr√©e consisted of some African themed delicacies too which were delectable and there were many to be offered in main course as well. The menu did offer cocktails/Mocktail featuring African themed taste which I thoroughly enjoyed.I was especially impressed by their consideration for others while playing loud music and we were enquired before hand if we were okay if the music played for 10 minutes. I have, in my years of dining experience in and around tricity have never been asked or even been considered-whether loud music played by almost all restaurants- disturbs our tranquility and dining experience or not! So it was a much refreshing change and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs on my top most recommendations!I don‚Äôt think I warrant any special recommendation for Barbeque nation because it cares and pays attention to what it‚Äôs customers want!! So if you want to have a deliciously fun night out, this is the place to be! Well done üëçüèª",2
"We generally have our team lunches here. it has always been a pleasurable experience, but today was different. For vegetarians the service was very slow and not up to the mark. It was great as usual for the non-vegetarians.",1
After a long break I visited the place and I noticed that service is faster I would like to thank Vicky for service. The tandoori quality was top notch but in the food menu i didn't like Manchurian The quality was not great. at the end dessert was top notch. I recommend you to visit this place for sure.,2
"I visited sector 26 BBQ after 7yrs to spend some quality time with with my sister and kids. I must say it was worth going there. The is staff so so very good, courteous , bas ji Dil Jeet liya with their multiple surprises and gestures.... Special thanks to staff members Pawan and Altaf(not sure exactly) for their great hospitality and friendliness....BBQ Nation you are just the best when we know there r many other restaurants on same theme..Vegetarian options: Great started including crispy corn, Cajun potato, cornKid-friendliness: The staff made sure kids r comfortable at place. They made special french fries, malai paneer tikka for kids. They took my heart when they prepared 2 cakes, 1 for bday gal and another fir cousin so tht bachha dukhi na ho.... Kids gave them thumbs up for their love...",2
A great experience and a wonderful staff. Taste was awesome and each item (even for a Veg) was delight. Crispy corn remains a favourite and so was the pineapple.Desserts had so many options but we were over stuffed already still managed to have a few. Reaching before certain timelines translates into cheaper rates as well.Good one. Loved it.,2
"Dalvir and his team served us really good. The entire team worked really hard and made my birthday really special. I am a lazy person who doesn‚Äôt want to type anything but because of the service they provided, I felt I should ayleast provide them a good feedback. Dalvir and team your service was excellent and food as well",2
"Once upon a time this place served on the the best barbecues in the city but now i believe that they get so much of the crowd, they believe maintaining the quality is not at all importantThe problems which we faced during our last visit are as follows1 Food that was served on the grill was half cooked2 Not all items in snacks was served, even upon asking was not served3 The staff was very rude and ignorant4 In the chicken Biryani, there was no sign on chicken, it was just rice, when asked the staff member, instead of giving an answer what i got was a shameless smileDefinitely not a place to visit anymore",0
I went there with my wife on her birthday. It was an amazing experience with wide variety of snacks and desserts. Main course was small but to the point.Recommended to have a lot of snacks and desserts. Wedding type setup. Weekends beverages are not the part of menu but on weekdays they are.Our server Vicky and Ravi are the two generous people who served us with all the delicacies with full zeal and enthusiasm.Barbeque nation is the best place of you want to throw up parties for your friends and family. I loved the place. Food is good and value for money.,2
Good place for outing with family and friends. This place is at sector 26 madhya marg. Food quality is great. Service is also good. Staff behavior is nice. Interior is cool. You want to  book your table in advance. Waiting for seat is really bad. Chef also take your opinion on food. Buffet system here. Price is 799 for both vegetarian and non- vegetarian buffet. Good place for small parties with friends.,2
"Staff was well mannered and we'll behaved
I will give 4 rating for food because that was not upto mark and to be honest they should improve dessert section",2
"I love the place, the ambience, the staff. Everything is just super. They keep asking about the quality and if we need anything else. We plan to visit other restaurants also but end up visiting this place üòÅ The food tastes so so good. I would definitely recommend people to visit here and I quite often do that as well.Parking: Generally we get but yes you have to find the parking. We go I the afternoon so we manage to get parking there.Kid-friendliness: I mean they don't have any separate room but kids visit there and the staff is supportive and caring.",2
"Situated on Madhya marg sector 26 before grain market sector 26 Chandigarh.Yumm food and nice interior. They offer small cake for b'days or anniversary.Starters are very good in taste. Ample space for couples, four or larger groups.drinks are also available.you can order online with good discount through their own app or zomato in which they offers their food in different meal boxes and thalisyou need to pay for sector parking space which is 14/- now.",2
Service by GOKUL was exceptional ! A must go place.,2
"On ths weekend we went to barbeque nation for birthday celebration of my friends üéâ. due to weekend place was completely packed with people's nd service was very very slow .we have to wait for long for thing to come on table .we had grilled chicken,prawns ,fish , mushroom nd paneer tikka,coming on main course very less option in main course in non veg i got only lal mass,butter chicken,fish that's it other varieties of non veg , desert section was good nd satisfying.at the end we had cake cutting ‚úÇÔ∏è.",0
"This place is fantastic for anyone but if you are a westerner visiting Chandigarh,  Barbecue Nation is a MUST !Choices, selection,  buffet, tableside fish, shrimp, chicken, mutton, and surprise samplings are amazing.Service,  quality, and price are fantastic!I am a return customer for sure.",2
I believe most of the time people come here to enjoy their night with fiends & family for memories I came with my family to celebrate my son birthday but The food  quality is not like a restaurant.  Just cook like street vendor. Service is very poor..üëéüëé avoid on weekendsit was good few years ago but really bad in quality. Not a recommended.. a small height manager fun on me when I asked for delay in bill . Staff keep asking you about  good service if u r not willing to give good feedback when your mood not goodI think go to others places  pirate of grill rather than spending and spoiling your memorable day here‚Ä¶,0
Amazing experience! Had a wonderful time. So much variety and highly courteous staff. I was gifted a surprise birthday cake and a beautiful birthday song sung by them. It was such a good feeling. Parents and kids enjoyed a lot. Non- ginger garlic food items were also prepared on demand. I can blindly trust Barbeque Nation when it comes to dining out!,2
"I would suggest not going on weekend as the place gets heavily crowded. Although the music was performed live but it sucked to be honest , and the power went off multiple times in the era of generators, inverters. Starters chicken quality  was good but maincourse chicken was either undercooked or the quality was bad. In dessert pastries were okayish, kulfi was good, small gulab jamun was the best of all. So overall considering all aspects of food, service, ambience, I would give 3 star at maximum",1
"Vegitarian buffet.Worst experience in my life.I made booking through official app for 1.30 PM, yesterday I was very excited because dine in is opened after a long time.I am very  disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è* I got a phone call from the outlet around 11.00 in the morning to change my reservation time due to covid measures they are fully occupied on slot of 1.30 pm, then I have to make changes according it. They offered me slot of 2.30 to 5.00PM we reach at the restaurant around 3.00 pm. Because of my busy schedule it's hard to make sudden change.*We reach there we have to wait for another 15 mins for our turn.*Finally our host guide us to our table and we waited another 20 mins for getting served our first snack.Starters are: rated out of 51. Achari Panner tikka 5 out of 5.2. Cajun potatoes 3 out of 5.3. Crispy corn 4 out of 5.4. Cheeze grilled mushroom 2 out of 5.5. Honey chilli pineapple 3 out of 5.6. Aloo tikki kabab 2 out of 5.7.

We personally notices 3 flies maybe there were more üëéüèªTip: For discounts because eazydiner dineout apps are not working at Saturday and Sunday,  if you have Paytm first points there are 2 coupons available  of rupees 250(in 500paytm first points) and 500(in 1000 Paytm first points) might be a limited period offer""(coupon of 500 rs applicable on bill of 3000 or above. whereas coupon of 250 works on total of 1500 or above.)On other weekdays you can pay through app but before that confirm it at the restaurant if they are accepting payments through these apps or not.In official app there are free 100 smiles  for extra discounts and earn more on every bill generated 1 smile = 1 Rupee.My overall experience is poor.Not recommended for vegitarians in chandigarh.GT road is much better option in same market.Manager was very polite he was very busy with everyone and announced our request on the mic, but no one entertained our request. management staff does have some issue with multitasking or maybe they were just ignorant.Last but not the least after we finished our starters and go for the maincourse they don't even empty the space of our table.I by myself took those plates and place on other table full with non veg leftovers to make some room.",0
"A good place with Good Ambience, the staff is also very friendly and is always at toes for whatever you want. You'll be always welcomed with warm faces and ready to serve customer attitude.The Food is also very good with proper seasoning and taste. But with such good food you need something to drink and there is only one Complimentry Drink served. For rest drinks you have to pay, water is exception as it is unlimited.",2
Worst service ever I order through Zomato.Then after 30 min order is getting delayed.After that I tried calling many times but staff of barbequenatiin is not responding. They not pic even a single call. Delivery partner is also waiting for the order but they are not responding to him. Zomato team also trying to contact them but still they are not responding. Finally order is cancelled by the barbequenation after one hour. This is the worst experience ever with this restaurant.,0
"Great place to have a dinner.Have been to many restaurants serving buffets in tricity, but BBQ nation tops it becoz of specialized service.Vijay and Suraj provided great service and were very helpful to consider small requests.",2
"It was really an amazing experience at barbeque nation.. their food was awesome, and loved their hospitality specially by Ankish who served dishes as per our requirement and made sure that we are comfortable at our table. Thank you Barbeque Nation for making our day special üòÄ",2

Good place to dine in with your family or friends. Food taste is average i.e. neither too good nor too bad. The staff is friendly and polite.,2
"This is a new favorite place for me to spend great time eating eating and eating all the amazing food they offer.Celebrated our company's (Digitofy - Best Rated Digital Marketing Company)5th founding day and all our team had a great time there.Would love to visit again and enjoy eating, eating and eating there.",2
It was really wonderful experience to have dinner there. The atmosphere is really good and proper hygiene maintained by staff. Food was extremely good. They made my birthday so special with yummy food. Overall satisfied ‚úåÔ∏è  ,2
"They never disappoint.
Tasty good, Quality food and services,
Supportive and corporative staff.
Special shout out to Amit (table attender)",2
"Good service and food. Starters are too good.

Vegetarian options: In veg grilled please try pineapple masala.",2
"Taste: 5/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 2/5Value for money: 2/5I visited this place to celebrate my friend's birthday last Saturday and would never suggest anyone visiting them on a weekend ever again. The service was painfully slow. We could hardly get any service. All the servers were loaded with the work. The reception never picked up my phone nor confirmed my online booking via dineout. My friend somehow got a booking from some other app. We reached at 9:00 pm, our scheduled time, and got our table by 9:20 pm. It took them 2.5 hrs to serve all the starters. I wonder if they can charge more for the weekends, can they not keep more staff for weekends. We ordered veg buffet for all. The taste was good and they would customise it as per your spice tolerance but when it will arrive is no guarantee. We got 6pcs of Soya chaap on a table of 10 and then it was all over. They didn't have any more. By the time we reached for main course, it had been heating for so long that I could only have curries. Dal makhani and paneer were good. Veg biryani was more like pulao. Roti and rice were good. Coming to desserts, I really liked the variety but sadly even there the live counter didn't have many options because of how late it had been because of the slow service. The red velvet cake was the highlight for me.Conclusion: Huge variety. Would not suggest on weekends. Value for money on weekdays. Advance booking is advised.",1
It is average or maybe below average for vegetarians staff is good but main course and desert are 50-50 if you will like to spend 800 to 900 on starters then it is good,1
Amazing experience under the supervision of Mr. Ganesh. Whole staff took special care of all the needs and flavours. Even served customised prawns to my friends. Had a great birthday celebration as well. Thank you team. We look forward to visit you again.,2
"If you like appetizers and desserts this is the place for you. The staff keeps refilling quickly and you can chose what you want to refill.The variety of appetizers..specially for vegetarians out there is great..non-vegetarian appetizers are great too.Don‚Äôt forget to try their kulfi, which has its own counter upfront and one can easily miss it.Other small advice is if you don‚Äôt like something don‚Äôt eat it, you will have plenty of choices and you might repent if you eat things you don‚Äôt relish.The main course was not that great..but that is possibly because you are full by the time you get to it.",2
"In tricity Barbeque 26 Chandigarh is best in the taste in all Barbeque outlets. Staff is good. You can book via Online or offline your table. Taste is good. Starters as well as main course for Veg and Non veg available. Restroom is clean. Before reservation, contact the team for best in offers. I personally book single buffet at around 700 per person and after applying coupon, its almost gone to 650 per person.",2
"I visited this BBQ outlet for the first time here in Chandigarh. Little bit unhappyüò† with their services, it was not upto the mark of BBQN, for which they are famous.  Sometimes I had to wait for a long for some items.....overall it was ok.",2
The food was extremely delicious. The ambiance was super cool. The behavior of the staff is amazing. They treat every guest so well. Best place I have ever been to. ‚ù§,2
"I love thier buffet, so many dishes are available, one time entry charges 900 in which you can eat as much as you can also they celebrate your birthday both options are available veg and non-vegFor more details follow me on instagram @Abhishek Explorer",2
WORST EXPERIENCE.. I VISTED TODAY FOR MY PARENTS ANNIVERSARY and they Ruined it. HORRIBLE STAFF with RUDE & CARELESS ATTITUDE.. I HOPE THEIR RESTAURANT GETS CLOSED PERMANENTLY.!!WE DIDNT EAT ANYTHING AT ALL.. AND THEY CHARGED FOR EVERYTHING!!! MAY THEY ALL GETS SUED.!!,0
I enjoyed it there a lot but the music was way too loud to have conversation. Starters were good non-veg items were very delicious.,2

"Staff sometimes get on your nerve, and keeps on irritating by asking stupid questions. Food is also not that good. Everything is overpriced not even worth the service",0
"Pre bookings, good dining experience with family and friends always.
Will be a Great Addition to business if tea and coffee hot beverages are also gets added to the menu especially after meals or with snacks.",2
"Sector 26- Chandigarh BBQ Nation‚Äôs ambiance is perfect for general dinner, celebrations, family gatherings, and friendly get-togethers. The lively atmosphere and the joy of shared grilling make it an ideal place to bond over good food and conversations plus the way they serve you and listen to your needs is very appreciative.",2
Barbeque Nation is so so good. It's one of the best buffets in Chandigarh. The staff is extremely polite and really helpful. It offers you all you can eat dining experience. From complimentary drinks to great starters to great food and amazing desserts! They also offer complimentary cakes for birthdays and anniversaries. You should definitely visit for a great food experience. You won't regret it at all!üòä,2
Very bad experience I went for my Anniversary celebration but very much disappointed after seeing their service starters and food. Have been paid 6500 bill for nothing. I never recommend to anyone. Look at ice cream falluda they serve. Very very bad experience. Pathetic services.,0
"Food was really good as compare to PRIATES OF THE GRILL, ELANTE CHANDIGARH and even service was on point and Manager Dalvir was very courteous to serve us very warmly and makes us feel comfortable. BBQ food was amazing and starters were same as we wanted non spicy as requested.KEEP UP GOOD WORK AND WE WILL VISIT BBQ NATION AGAIN SOON",2
"Well it's Barbeque, who the hell I'm to review it's food quality üòÖI'm here to review it's cleaning, staff behaviour, washroom quality, about location and very little but quite effective for some reasons. So I'm totally satisfy with above point which I'm mentioned. Service is impressive and direct effect to heart üåº. It's service is like habits of something. Sorry but it's true, that I'm your lifetime customer üôà",2
"All you can eat : Well, you know what to expect- loads of unlimited food, when you visit such a place. Barbeque nation never disappoints on this front. The preparation is also good - particularly crispy corn and kulfi. Go there only when you are really hungry. Service and ambience is mediocre.",2
"Very very bad place. Please do not visit this place as consumers. The manager Parvez does not know what he‚Äôs doing. We went there and took a table and we were asked that we will start your food. We said we are waiting for two of our friends then after 15 minutes, this Manager comes and says that this is already reserved. Just because probably he got guests  of more number absolutely absolutely nonsense and rubbish place as aware consumers Please do not visit this place. Shameful and disgraceful conduct by the manager Parvez I do not know why Barbeque nation is hanging on to such useless people. He should be fired right away, who does not know how to treat his guests.",0
"Use to be good place to have Buffet. But with the competition in the market they did not upgraded.
Visit after 3years and they were excellent üëç.
Complementary cakes on Special occasions..",2
Good hygienic food under one roof. One can enjoy buffet. One feedback add som mor unique desert's items and your staff can't click pics in good way.,2
"I visited this place last week to have lunch buffet with my friends. It was completely filled with the people. Appetizers were good but the soya chaap was dry. I liked their kebabs and crunchy corns alot. I had many expectations from their main course as well but it turned out completely opposite as the variety was very less and only shahi paneer was decent out of all. Daal was completely bland in taste, mix veg was also just decent. Dessert was complete disappointment for me as the cakes and pastries felt dry and stale. Phirni was just decent and flooda was also tasteless. Their plates were not even properly clean. Though they have raised their prices but it wasn't worth the money.",0
The place is not advised to be visited during weekends and national holidays as due to huge crowd services become pathetic. There were even flies flying in cake section. Totally unhygienic. They were not even refilling cake section. Empty trays.Actual problem is that they have increased the tables and decreased the staff. All people around my table were fighting for poor service.,0
"Everything was great. Live music, great food, good service, rejoicing atmosphere. Only music was loud and could not make a great farewell party. I think theh must have some cutouts.",2
"The best in service, Starters are fine but main course should be improved",2
"Good place to hangout with family, ambiance is amazing. Food quality is okay, they also have drinks , live kitchen, lots of snacks to fill you up. Overall experience is good, must visit to have a wonderful evening.",2
Great place toh party and buffet. They have great variety of cuisine and their way of celebrating one's occation is also awesome. One must go and check their buffet once. Had a great experience and staff was also good.,2

"Brilliant. Great ambiance, great food and a very cool layout along with behaved and hospitable staff. Worth a visit.",2
"Stale , pathetic food , have visited so many times earlier but now it‚Äôs standard has fallen beyond imagination.. very very poor food ‚Ä¶ highly disappointing",0
We have visited barbeque nation after a long time but to our surprise the experience was pathetic. The food quality was not good and the service was so slow that it took 20 mins to start serving. The servers are very rude which is least expected from this place where servers were too prompt to serve. We got so frustated that we left our meal in between. I would not recommend anyone looking for a good time to visit this place because they would make sure to make it worst.,0
Never disappoints meüôåüèª,2
The best Barbecue Nation outlet in India for sure! Amazingly courteous service by whole staff and great food options! Must visit for a sumptuous and fulfilling meal. üëç,2
Wonderful service and the staff was so sweet ‚Ä¶ I recently celebrated my birthday there they were so warm and caring‚Ä¶ I strongly recommend it and give it 11/10 superb I mean,2
"It was An Excellent Experience.
The hospitality And The  service was Superb. No words to Explain how much we liked it.
Hat's off to you",2
"This place should be in the list of top restaurants. I mean it has everything:1) Washrooms are clean tidy and maintained.2) The staff is super polite, well trained and lovely. They know how to behave properly.3) The food is amazing! Ranging from starters to desserts, this place is the best!4) They also give cakes for any celebration without charging more.5) People are down to earth there, and I don't expect any negative comments from the people who went there.6) They daily have an event where the chef, waiters and other staff members perform a dance.7) Getting a reservation is easy just download their app from respective App Store and book it right away WITHOUT PAYING ADVANCE OR EXTRA BOOKING CHARGES!!!If you are  confused in Pirates of Grill and Barbeque Nation, then definitely go for the latter; it is far more better than the Pirates of Grill.Signing offKanav :-)",2
"Some food items are not good like pasta, pineapple caramel, etc. All other items are delicious such as salsa potato palak patta chat. In dessert, I recommend eating tutty fruity ice cream, browny with ice cream.",2
The place was so good .staff was so nice .they care for your feedback.  the food was not that much spicy which is good . I'll give 8/10 for FOOD..  and for the service n Atmosphere I'll rate 9/10,2

Visited again on 29/09/2022. The overall experience was amazing and the hospitality of the entire team managed by Mr. Jimmy deserves special mention.,2
The buffet us really awesome food is good but sometimes you may face barbeque issues it doesn't bake your stuffs. I really enjoyed my first visit.,2
If you're planning to visit this place for Lunch or dinner then book your table in advance through BBQ app and you will also get some cashback. They offer the best buffet in the city. Staff is very cooperative and it's a neat and clean place. I enjoyed the starters more then main course. They service is very quick. Food is hygienic. Overall it is good place if you're looking for a buffet lunch and dinner.,2
"The place is amazing for the food it offers, it's always full , so it's good if you pre-book or reserve the table.The food is good, dessert selection is the best!",2
"",2
The Barbeque Nation Sector-26 is a decent place to have a buffet lunch or dinner with friends or family. The service is decent but definitely can be improved a notch. The food is a little above average. They can definitely explore more options in the buffet menus to attract more customers.Overall the ambience is good.,1
"Good but not the best, it was not worth the money for what we have payed, we payed like 6k for 4 people and we haven't even eaten so much, a single person sitting next to us ate more than us 4. I will recommend this place of your friends eat like animals ‚ù§Ô∏èParking: Parking was full and we had to wait 1 hours outside the building as their waiting area was also full. My cousins from Canada has the worst experience.",2

"Chandigarh is blessed to have quite a few good Restaurants that serve authentic North Indian cuisine ........ and amongst them Pashtun would surely rate very high. Restaurant going strong since 1990. Good strong flavours and the dishes are really well cooked. We were pleasantly surprised to try their Masala Tandoori Roti. The quintessential Tandoori Roti has been given a marked makeover with the simple addition of some onions, masalas and spices. Infact the hack is so simple that we were surprised why the other Restaurants haven't caught on to this as yet. Good meal and strongly recommended for good North Indian food.",2
"Super nice restaurant! Amazing environment and the food is incredible. From an european perspective, this was really really good.",2
"Old theme styled like haveli. Some items are very good some are average.
Pathar mutton kabab is a must if you are mutton lover.
Need some cleanliness tree they added in the middle having so much dust.",2
"The overall dining experience was rather average, with a taste that didn't stand out. Despite having dinner, there was an expectation for a unique or surprising element in the flavors that was not met.",1
"Recently went there to celebrate my wedding anniversary lunch with my family. The food was okay okay some starters were not up to the mark and main course was okay okay types. ambience is alright. There was not a lot of noise so that was good.Overall, it‚Äôs a decent place to go out with family but I felt that it did not do justice to how highly people talk about this specific restaurant.",1
"I went here with my 2 friend after reading quite a lot reviews. It was a horrible experience. As soon as we ordered, waiter told us that it will take some time to prepare as it is rush hour. We ordered boneless chicken biryani and veg biryani.The rice used for biryani was not basmati some tasteless rice and the thing that irritated us to the core was.. there were multiple bones in bones biryani.We told them them there are bones in boneless.. so he got it checked.. and refilled the bowl..Since we didn‚Äôt like the food, we asked them to pack it and my goodness even manager came to tell us that they don‚Äôt  pack and all things. I asked them what will you do with leftover? He said we will throw.I mean, they prefer  to throw rather than packing. Had a really bad lunch here and I suggest everyone ask them why they throw instead of packing the leftovers.",0
Black glasses on the door gives it dingy look but not bad once inside. The huge tree replica is very much like real one.Wasn‚Äôt much hungry so we only ordered biryani and chicken gravy which was delicious. Enough portion for 2 people to eat from. They had good offer for üç∫ but had none(day time)Food could have been digested well with it though.It was not a busy place n not enough servers except a cook cooking in the kitchen and a server serving it.,1
I visited here a day before valentine 2019 & i have dinner.. It seems to look like a historical place full with an atmosphere of our Indian culture as like the paintings on the walls and the menu of the restaurant looks quite different then others as i likes the most and talking about the food it was good in quality and the staff is also good and you can easily take a view of chef's they were just busy in cooking but they did there job very well and that make the food more delicious and hopefully the environment was smooth inside the restaurant..,2
We had tasty chicken handi and tandoori chicken. 6 pieces of chicken wings were also yummy. Definitely worth a visit. Fast service. Ample parking.,2
Its been 3 years i have been coming here and i always have a really good experience here. Good ambiance staff was very good specially Vicky sir who served us really well,2
In terms of taste and service this is good restro bar. Actually they have 2 floor ground and basement. Resto bar is in basement and on ground floor only restaurant. I always prefer to sit in restrobar. Everything is fine but loud third class music. I think as per atmosphere and sitting they should play Gazals.,2
A perfect place to visit to try the North Indian fare. They call themselves as the oldest Ethnic Indian Restaurant and stands true. The Ambience is well done and is very calm and soothing. The Food is really nice both Non veg and Veg. The chicken starters are well marinated and cooked really well. Chicken Rarra is nice and the chilli garlic naan is a must try. Dal Bhukhara is good too. over all a great place to eat a good North Indian fare in chandigarh.,2
Good place for non veg lovers. Good ambiance and service. Place downside name as Wild west.Must try:Murg tikka afganiMurg malai tangriPaneer makhan masalaMutton sikandari raan,2
"5 stars for the amazing ambience they have made, service is ok, food is decent, they have a themed bar in the basement by the name wild west cafe, they should work on improving its ventilation or turn on atleast one ac in the basement for air flow",2
"Its my birthday week, I was looking for a value for money buffet for 30 pax and somehow visited this place for a trial. I was accompanied by my vegan friend. So we opted for a veg and a non veg buffet.Self service, only breads are served on table which are hot n fresh.The taste of almost all the dishes wasnt good at all.Only russian salad was fine.Vadilal icecream is also okay but they lack hot sweetdish option.The ambience is okay.The view is fine.",0
"Ambience is very good. Food quality is at par. Both veg and non veg preparation is very nice. Non veg pieces are too huge though, should ask for smaller pieces.",2
"Food is out of this world. The tandoori roti is crisp and the preparations are delicious yet  light on the stomach.
Strongly recommend.",2
"Great place for families, Very nice ambiance. Food is good, pure ethnic indian food with amazing quality. Staff was friendly and helpful, They also have bar with separate sitting .Highly recommended for peaceful family dinners",2
O bhai...kuch toh image ka khyal karo.....such a big disappointment......went there after so many years......went to their bar in the basement....mosqitos went in my glass three times....left food just because of that thing only....hygine naam ki bhi koi cheez hoti hai....I paid the bill and left the place....very sad experience.....,0
"Excellent service. Good food and good environment. Must visit.
Must try Malai chaap.",2
"Visited this high rated restaurant with high expectations, only to be deeply disappointed. I ordered chicken kebab and naan. I'm sad to say that I had the worst chicken and that too in Punjab. Absolutely pathetic. Don't trust the reviews.",0
My family is fond of the place especially my mother. Good food preparation. Pretty good ambience. Tree in the center is its TRP.Service i think has gone on the slower side since our last visit. Also the capacity check was not done here considering covid scare. I mean 50% is allowed i assume and only two tables were left vacant rest all were full. Here the manager looses some point. Also please work up some quantity too,1
"Great place for families,very nice ambience.food is good,pure ethnindian food with amazing quality",2
"Because of our less tolerance for spices and chillies,We did customize some of of the food. Waiter did explain that it might impact taste but we still went ahead and ordered it. Chef made sure the dish was still perfect and taste awesome. VERY NICE FOOD.",2
"Poor and slow service with unresponsive hosts .
Food was fabulous, great Indian authentic food , super taste , ambience was very good , cost is also very well planned , a complete family restaurant.",2
"If you‚Äôre looking for the best indian food in Chandigarh, you should definitely try this place. Just perfect",2
"Great Food with authentic mouth watering flavours
Staff is very warm and service is with a smile",2
"It's an ok place nothing to rave about. We went with super high expectations and that's why we were disappointed. Food tastes fine and that's why the 2 stars.Portions are small for the price, place is dimlit and restrooms are dirty and reek badly, service is passable and kitchen looks disorganised.Overall this restaurant is passable!",0
The food was yum and amazing. Must try place. The staff behaviour was also very amicable and nice.,2
Traditional ambiance with traditional food! Tastes great!! Staff is very friendly and good service!! Should  try once!!,2
"Calm, cozy, ambience with yummy mouth watering dishes served by professionals. I really enjoy this place whenever I visit",2
"The food, presentation and the staff was really very badThey had bad services as wellSpecially Mr Vicky he didn't even attendedAnd there was only one staffNever visit again",0
Nice and quiet place to enjoy wholesome meal.,2
"Decent service and ambience but food was not upto the mark. We ordered Mutton gravy but it couldn't justify even half of it's price in taste and quality. In veg, we tried kadhai paneer which was still better.",1
From last 20 years we r regular customer. This time quality of food was pathetic. Half cooked chicken with watery gravy. I thought to have word with u but u were busy with sme of ur friend's.If the quality of food will bw likw this only then i shd not recommend anyone.They had charged for this half cooked chicken.If quality will be like this only then dont waste hard money fo ur old customer's .,0
Nice place to have romantic dinner or enjoy with Family. It offere very soothing ambience and great food with live music. It gives you both option i.e. to sit inside or roof top sitting. It is also known as Chandigarh Haveli    I had a great time there and I must appreciate the staff for giving us such a great experience. For more Chandigarh restaurant reviews do visit my Instagram page dil_apna_foodie.,2
One of the oldest restaurants in Chandigarh and visit this place regularly for family dinners. All our guests review liked this place especially the Daal.   Other dishes have neutral masalas and are not high spices. The overall interiors of this place are good with its nomadic paintings on the wall. Food is priced reasonably.,2
Food and service was amazing. Humble person but the ambience was a bit dull.,2
"Visiting this place from the last 10 year with my family.
Always satisfied with delicious food & drinks.
Good atmosphere if you are going with family.",2
Ambience and food is good. A very quiet environment. Nice family palce to hangout with.,2
1. Worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant.2. No napkins given to our table and when demanded for it then it was told that they don't have enough in stock but same we're available on unused tables.3. For any order you have to wait for long time and my case I have to wait for each chapati with pause of 10 minutes.5. Non of the staff member supervision is taken and in case customer is looking for the staff you need to have good luck if you find any on time.6. Food quality is no more icon of the restaurant which was in early period.7. I gave 2 stars just because of the infrastructure otherwise it doesn't even deserve one star.Management need to keep an close eye watch on it if they need to survive for long in the business.,0
"Used to go to this place a lot and was one of my favourites. Recently, i visited this place and food was below average. Ordered butter chicken and it was not even cooked properly , way undercooked and the chef said that it was cooked perfectly , well that was not the case at all. Pathetic food and pathetic staff , won‚Äôt visit again. Bad experience. They compromised quality for quantity.",0
"Used to be a good place to hangout, and had been here quite a few times, may be more than 20. Over the years, the restaurant has only went downwards, in terms of food quality and even more in terms of behaviour of serving staff. The prices have gone at par with best restaurants like dastaan and anardana, but quality is not even up to halfway mark. Some servers, that are at this place from past many years, behave rudely with guests.",0
"The food was really bad. The onions and chutney were stale.The service was of very poor quality. The waiters weren't even listening to us.We had to get up from there without finishing food, it was that bad.",0
Our office is just next to this place and it has one of the best food. Very nice staff..they serve alcohol too...they have a bar in basement and the restaurant is on ground floor. Must visit with family or friends.,2
Had dinner there but was of average taste.,1
Delicious food and nice ambience üëçüå∫‚Ä¶..place need renovation ‡••,2
Worse experience . Does not care about customer . Commit something and don't live up to it ...owner is rude and does not care about customer ...they say we are here since last 25 years we don't care about any thing ......will never recommend Ny one to go,0
"Had the traditional local dish of chicken Makhan. It was good, but not sure if its worth so much. Close to 500 rs for one dish. Could give it a try once.",1
Nice food. Neat and clean place.,2
"Food is very good, ambience is average plus, pub downstairs is one of the favorite and quiet hangout place for over 20 years. They used to call it Khyber then, now it's called Wild Wild West.",2
"Great ambience, courteous staff. Taan Dera Ismail Khan is a must try dish for mutton lovers",2
I ordered dal makhani and tandoori roti from here. The dal makhani was awesome but I m giving 3 stars because the quantity was very less for rs.300.. Didn't even suffice.. this was disappointing..,1
"It was wonderful. Kudos to the chef.interior is good too.worth the visit.i am editing this after 2 years. Service, quality is not worth worth it. We ordered gobi kali mirch and it is not the same taste it used to be. I discussed with owner and he didn't waive off the price which we didn't eat. Golden days are over. Would never visit again. Dissatisfied and disappointing üòë",1
"Nice place to have punjabi food with very nice ambience.
Staff is very cooperative and we'll behaved.",2
"Quality of food both veg and nog veg really delicious.
Must visit üòã",2
"Ok ok type restaurant, nothing spl...Food quality is also below average...Little over price as compare to food quality and service....",0
"They are dishonest people, they don‚Äôt honour reservation of table at the hotel.",0
Great food.. Great ambience.. Nice service..,2
Visited with friends on 11th May.Ordered veg and non veg food. The quality of food was upto the mark.Service was promptAmbience is vibrant!!!A must visit.,2
"This might be the only time I have felt uncomfortable while dining in a restaurant because of the sheer rudeness and aggressive behaviour of the staff. I tried to order something and the servers simply refused to listen. On pointing this out, one of them became incredibly aggressive. Not to mention the horrible horrible food- we‚Äôd ordered the methi chicken, dal bukhara, lachha parantha, jaljeera and coke- and the best thing was the coke.",0
worst....in this hot summer...ac is not working at all...manager says...the problem is from mall side....30 degree temperature and i am full of sweat...please dont come in the summer...ac is not working at all..,0
Food is of average quality ..not too bad but the price charged for the same is not justified at all. The service provided by the staff was nice and they were quick and humble.The quantity was okay as well. This rating comes totally as a result of the high price charged for the average food provided by them.,0
The food was awesome whether it was veg or non veg. The atmosphere was pretty peaceful and food tasted delicious!,2
Very bad service and food. No manners of waiters way of speaking.,0
"Visited the restaurant yesterday with family. Great location, nice and cosy ambience, food is okay..neither greatt nor bad, pricing is a bit on higher side.The worst part is their staff and service. They are polite but 2 of them were extremely sarcastic. They are not bothered that in today's hard times, they are getting business. Manager was most unmanaged, no speed in service at all. When we asked them to pack the leftover food so that it is not wasted, the staff serving us made faces of all kinds.Most Lethargic and unprofessional staff. Okay for one time visit. But will SURELY not go again..",0
Food taste is not that great... good family restaurant...,2
"Though the ambience is nice. Staff is good and hospitality is great. But the taste of main course items like mutton Rogan Josh and mutton handi is not upto the mark. Also meat is too chewy. It is bit over priced too.
Chicken malai tikka is a must try here.",0
Amazingv authentic and delicious Indian cuisine.,2
Ac not working. Service slow. Food taste average,0
Rude owner does not have any sence to talk to customer ....pathetic service ....bad experience will not recomend,0
Always love to be here for yummy food.. Great ambiance. Professional staff and more over the owner is a great chef... Always relish food here..,2
"Food is sumptuous and quality has been maintained..
Courteous & helpful staff‚Ä¶.
Do sit by the window table (corner) and watch the world go by..",2
Ambience is great. Hospitality is weak. Food quality in Vegetarian is good (especially Daal Bukhara) but Non Veg is not good. You order them spicy food and they will serve you sweet food. Location wise great and one of the oldest restaurant of City. Centrally located in the heart of City at Sector 35 Chandigarh.,2
"Misleading name, mediocre food and overpriced menu",0
Was thinking have to gud food ‚Ä¶ Bhut hi bkwas taste of mutton rogan josh . Only good thing is. Coke Bas ..  disappointed üòî,0
Unprofessional and inexperienced staff. We were asked to control our child who is just 2.7 yrs old as others were getting disturbed by manager. The manager talked mannerlessly with us. Quality food is not only thing one looks forward for. We as parents know how to n when to control r kids n the manager was v rude. Restaurants are not libraries where we need to keep pin drop silence and we come with our families to enjoy knowing our limits. I will never recommend this restaurant to the families who have kids as the unprofessional staff will then ask you to control them. It was an awful experience.,0
They are worst . They don‚Äôt even know how to handle and hospitality is worst . Lighting is bad . I came here on my birthday to have a dinner . And suddenly they started that kitchen is closed and even they take the order and doing all the things so fastly just to wrap the things . If you know that the kitchen is closing please inform otherwise tell them from outside . Ridiculous man,0
"Possibly the best mutton preparations we have ever had. Very good food, relaxed ambience for that prolonged drinks plus meal - and the price is a pleasant surprise",2
A cozy place for a family dine-in occasions.,2
Best and oldest restaurant of Chandigarh. Visiting this place from last 30 years. The washrooms need improvement.,2
"Worst experience ever. After waiting for exactly 41 minutes we got our food on our table. Food was so pathetic, Manchurians were burned. Butter naan was so hard we cant even chew them properly, we received 7 pieces of honey chilly cauliflower at rs 350. After all this waiter was like sir wait to aapko krna pdega itna bda restaurant hai or kaam krne waale sirf 2 log hai hum aap pls jaldi na mchaao or wait kro.. If you guys are not capable of running this place please shut it down üôèüèª don't do such kind of harassment.",0
"Ambience good and food not so good as expected. Ordered karahi paneer and dal tarka , but didn't find so good. Spicy and quality not as per expected.Service good .",2
"Chicken malai tikka was on other level, not the regular creamy one,but fresh, juicy n tender.Tandoori wings were delicious.Butter chicken was yummmMalai kofta was a total fail.... absolutely bland, weird coconut taste, we requested to add lil salt n spice but they failed to do so.",2
BAD PLACE. THEY SERVE BACHA KUCHA HUA FOOD.TAKE YOUR DOG ALONG TO EAT. DOG WILL ENJOY EATING THE FOOD .BAD BAD BAD PLACE.WORST PLACE IN CHANDIGARH.,0
Food was decent but service is not upto mark. We went to celebrate Father's day  and found that the service was pretty lagging. Only two people were serving food.,1
"Pather kebab and raan were delicious, however main course was not not upto mark.Butter chicken and handi gost was average. House special icecream is waste.Ambience is good",1
The delicate place to dine in . The literal taste of indian authentic   food. Try jaljeera,2
"Great ambience for a family dinner.Personally, I love the food here and that's what makes me go there again and again. Best authentic mughlai food in town. Must try chicken kebabs and soya kebabs for vegetarian. Butter chicken is my favourite here.Cons:Service is not consistent but food makes up for that ;)Not sure why but their menu doesn't have any markings for veg/non-veg. Not even the colour coding. Hope they change that soon.",2
Very tasty food available and pleasant atmosphere.,2
"Nice place for having drinks and Food. Situated at sector 35 in the heart of city, serves very good Food. There tandoori items are too delicious. You have multiple options on drinks",2
One star for ambience. Others are very poor. The quality and quantity of food is of average grade. A lot has to improve to maintain quality.,0
"Outstanding food... Outstanding hospitality!!!Revisited Pashtun...Have been coming here since 1996 or 1997...The standards have not changed...Maybe better... Amazing food, hospitality, service...Most of the staff is the same...Speaks volumes!Sanjiv runs a great ship...Keep it up!A visit to Chandigarh is incomplete without a meal @ Pashtun!!!",2
Pashtun ...ambience is good but if you are craving for non veg then guys this is  surely not the place...well i read the reviews and happened to go to this place. Chicken Pashtun Biryani and Panner Pashtuni we ordered ...well the name looks so alluring so we thought of trying these somewhat new dishes...but the dishes were just n just average...u will find panner pashtun which is nothing but any normal panner kadhai with normal taste...n biryani was also full bland...no aroma no taste...and guys rates are really on higher side...well told the service guy also that their food needs improvement but then he was least bothered ...anywaz no hardfeelings but surely not going second time,0
"Lip smacking non-veg starters & main course. A nice place to hand with family & friends. Interiors are classic, as it is one of the oldest restaurants of city. Quantity is bit on lower side when compared to prices, but taste overcomes this.",2
"Very good restaurant.
Local India cuisine.
Highly recommended!",2
"Nice ambience , good food but they need to improve their serving time as we waited for almost more than 40 mins after giving the order, however, I don't want to blame the staffs as the shortfall can be due to covid.",2
My sons first ever outing was to this restaurant. Will always be special. Good food and good service. Was expecting it to be a Buffet type but it has ala‚Äô carte only.,2
"Just like any other restaurant but ridiculously expensive, may be rents are high here, although preparation was fresh and food was tasty. Excellent service.",1
Really good food and a nice place for families to eat. Shandy and cocktails are also good. I recommend trying this place. Pathar kababs are really well prepared and a must try.,2
Perfect restaurant for family lunch,2
I must say their Dal makhni is to die for. A beer boot to my surprise actually cane in a boot shape glass. Must visit fir good indian food.,2
Very good food.. especially the chicken dishes...,2
"Everything about this is good, calm atmosphere, delicious food, cozy interior. Must visit for anyone coming to Chandigarh.",2
"One of the finest dining resturants in chandigarh.
Great food, great Ambience,  live kitchen",2
The most underrated restaurant in chandigarh. It has an excellent food and ambience. Will recommend for any family outing.,2
Excellent food and survice..üòÄüòÄ corporative staff. Very good place to eat and spend quality time with your family and friends..Thank you,2
This is a great place for traditional Indian Punjabi and Mughalai food. Nice interior decor with a desert theme and a tree in the middle and a wild west bar in the basement. Good food overall.,2
Food is amazing. The best for Indian cuisine. The menu is not very extensive but they ensure flavour and quality in every preparation. Definitely my favourite in Chandigarh!,2
"Peaceful place with light music and sweet volume good food with great service. Friendly and very humble staff, waiters give good suggestions in ordering food and drinks. Good place for hanging out with friends and like mind people, and equally good if you go alone.",2
"Walking through the lanes beneath the flickering glow of streetlights, I found myself standing in front of this famous restaurant. Amidst the cosy ambience, a lone man sat on a podium, lost in the enchanting melody of his flute. As he played, the soft, melodious notes filled the air, creating an atmosphere of serenity and intrigue. While I relished the food I had ordered, his fingers danced gracefully over the silver keys of the flute, producing a hauntingly beautiful tune that just transported me to a whole different world.",2
"Very cool atmosphere, cool music, washroom clean.The mocktails are unique and very tasty.The starters are very tasty.Only one thing more soup option should be there.Taste of all foods are very good.Overall very good experience.Unique process of order and bill pay.",2
"Wonderful experience! The food is amazing.. presentation,taste,price, quantity everything is very good. Loved being here . They dont have a huge menu .. very selected items available here. The beverages aren't that good..the food though is superb! Recommended",2
"Atmosphere was greatFood was okay, ordered Broccoli soup, which should have had a bit green texture which was not. Taste was not good.Salad was unique but I did not enjoy kurkure much on the salad.",2
"Lovely place for family seating. Great ambiance, good food with a lot of options to choose from. Pani puri shots as welcome drink were amazing. We tried Nadru ki tikki, Chicken tikka and Paneer tikka as starters. Daal Dastaani and another chicken dish for main course.",2
Excellent food. Very good ambience. Friendly staff. Little overpriced and slow service.,2
The food was good. Nothing extraordinary but it was good. The drinks were the star of the night. They had amazing drinks and a wide variety in them. Must try!,2
"Great addition to Chandigarh dining spots. Great casual ambience. Indoor and covered outdoor seating. Menu has plenty indo Italian fusion and traditional mughlai. We ordered the butter chicken, nihari mutton and daal makhni. Moist towels and sauna packets at end add a great touch.   Topped off with double Glen.. Laccha and tandoori nans were flavorful.. be back for a full meal.Parking: Could use staff to manage restaurant parking",2
"Need reservation for a better placelive music makes the atmosphere better.Food taste is good in some and average in other.Try panipuri shots, unique try.Mocktails have new varieties but read before ordering.Price is on the little higher side. Compare to taste it's not fine but overall it's okay.All types of payment options are available",2
"Last night, I and my friends had an excellent and delicious dinner at Dastaan, Sector-7, Chandigarh. The ambience and aroma of the restaurant was amazing. We were feeling comfortable sitting inside, the staff members were cooperative. We ordered Garlic Naan, Butter Naan, Laccha Parantha, Dal Makhni, Shahi Paneer, boondi Rieta.. it was satisfying and wonderful experience at Dastaan. Highly recommended!",2
"very beautiful attire, foods are amazing...both veg n nonveg are awesome.....If u go in winters,they will provide u angithi for feeling warm......And that basoori wala.(flute player) was really awesome,playing ur old is gold songs of Bollywood....",2
"I had the pleasure of dining at Dastaan, and I must say that it was an amazing experience! I give this restaurant a 5-star rating for the delectable starters and main course that we enjoyed.The starters were simply fantastic, and each dish was bursting with flavors that left us craving for more. The staff were very attentive and made sure that our experience was nothing less than perfect. They were very helpful in suggesting dishes that were suited to our taste and preferences.The main course was equally delightful. The dishes were presented beautifully and tasted absolutely amazing. The quality of the food was top-notch, and the portion sizes were just right. It was evident that the chefs put a lot of thought and effort into every dish they prepared.The ambience of the restaurant was also great, and the decor added to the overall experience. The music was just perfect and not too loud, allowing us to have a pleasant conversation while enjoying our meal.Overall, I highly recommend Dastaan to anyone who is looking for a fine dining experience with exceptional food and service. The team at Dastaan truly knows how to create an unforgettable dining experience, and I can't wait to go back again!",2

"Scrumptious fine dining place.

They have selected food items in their menu but each item is a chef's masterpiece.",2
"Let me just say snacks are a little overpriced for quantity, but apart from that its a good family restaurant. Food is good. We were billed for 3,700 bucks for dinner of 6 people but no drinks. We also got 2 servings of golgappas which were on the house. It's always good to have something free to eat (LOL).",2

"Just visited tonight and loved it. Restaurant was almost fully occupied. Still the taste, service, and ambience was well maintained.We ordered Kathal Galouti Sliders, Chicken Tikka orange salad and Roohafza Fresh lime.Everything tasted almost perfect, and the dishes made us both feel full.Keep it up!",2
The place has amazing ambiance. The food is fantastic but the portions are small . The service is very good.,2
"Dastaan is definitely one of the nicest places for family outing/dinner. This was my 2nd time at this place and we certainly had a great time with live music(flute) and sumptuous food. We started with ‚ÄúIndian Railways Tomato soup‚Äù which tasted more like tomato shoraba and was not thick in consistency. After that we ordered starters(Paneer kurchan taco, sev puri cornets, Asian Tangdi kebab)which  tasted average, personally I only liked Asian Tangdi kebab and good thing was it was not very spicy.Post that we ordered ‚Äúsame old Paneer makhni‚Äù which really good and was rich in flavour. We also ordered 2 drinks, ‚ÄúBanarasi Paan‚Äù and ‚ÄúAam panna‚Äù which tasted really well and even the presentation was exceptional.The best part of dinner was definitely desserts, where we had lemon cheesecake and phirni(comes with dry ice in a bowl, looks really cool), gulab jamun with rabdi.If I have to pick 3 things where the restaurant excels is their beverages, desserts and live music.I went there with my 2 year old son and there were lot of other families with their kids. My son was playing with other kids for most of the time we were there.They even offer complimentary Golgapasüòä and I would definitely love to visit this restaurant again!",2
Nice place to hangout and eat good food. Visited with family and the experience was tremendous. Loved how they treat their guest and explain about the dishes when you try to order it. Cocktails are good if one do not prefer to drink hard drinks. Recommended place to visit. They do not accept any booking for table. One can visit around 7-8PM to get a table else there will a waiting for at-least 30-40 mins.,2
"Nice food, wonderful ambience, nice cutlery.We ordered vegetarian food including Dal Dastani, Moroccan Panneer, Rajma Gutta Curry.Food was very good, presentation was also good, staff was courteous.Pan Ice-cream in the last was icing on the cake.Good experience, Highly recommended",2
"I have been to Dastaan a couple of times and unhesitatingly I can assure all that you would never get a meal that is below par! The indo fusion food they serve dances long onto your palette, after you are done savouring it-accompanied with the polite hospitality-is the reason you would always want to return to this restaurant.It‚Äôs comforting to note that even nowadays they still adhere to covid protocols- with contactless menu and payment options-and the bottle of sanitizer still present, while many of the other restaurants have let go! I would highly recommend this place if you are in the mood of a dining experience that feels familiar yet is strikingly different! üëçüèª",2
"Good flute music, gr8 atmosphere, polite helpfull staff, food was OK, would suggest a little refurbish in the menu, taste needs a little upgrade . Overall an OK experience,  daal and tandoori paneer gravy miss that extra punch.",1
"A good family restaurant. Little overpriced for everything. They serve gol gappas as the welcome snack. Food quality was good but the quantity was little less. In terms of taste, everything was little sweet like even if we have ordered something spicy, that has a taste of little sweetness in the end. The hospitality was very polite, liked the ambience and overall service was good.We ordered a lot of things like tomato soup, mushroom soup, paneer and mushroom tikka, biryani with raita, daal makhani, patiala paneer, malai kofta along with bread.Overall experience was good.",1
I went there to celebrate my birthday and it was amazing. The environment was peaceful with soft music and the staff members were very accommodative.l really enjoyed the night.,2
The food was extraordinary but the flute show was out of this world !!!!....hats off to the staff üëèüëèüëåüëåüôèüôè(Ps: the blueberry kulfi is worth a try),2
This place fits snug amongst all the bars and party places of sector 7 which have loud music and party arrangements. Unlike them dastaan offers a different ambience with good spacious seating arrangements and they had traditional Rajasthan live music too the night we visited.Staff are well mannered and courteous.Food is a mix of Indian and Arabic cuisine and many of the items we tried provided a different taste.Drinks are mostly the same as the other restaurants but are worth it too.A bit heavy on the pocket but it's a good place to spend your evening.,2
"A beautiful and lovely restaurant for family, friends and couples. Ambience wonderful. food awesome, staff polite, service good. Loved every thing about this place.  The chicken tikka clear soup was super hit. Rarra ghosht a must try and the desserts were my favourite. We ordered Thanda jamun - Garam Rabri and it was yummm. White chocolate and lemon cheesecake was also awesome. And yes a complimentary panipuri in the starting and the masala peanut with the drinks gets the brownie points.",2
"One of the best restaurants I've been to in Chandigarh. Cocktails and mocktails were great and food quality and quantity was excellent üëåüèº I love the idea of Gulkand infused with white rum, I'm gonna try this at home üòÅ",2
"Location: Sec 26 Backside ‚Äúsip n dine‚ÄùPrices: 1000 for 2 peopleDastaan have great, yet different aroma in the air. Great ambience and sitting. Dedicated tables for 2, 4 and then groups. Advise is to check availability or book a table beforehand. High rush at weekends and dinner time, so may need to wait for turn.Regular kind of meal daal makhani, rice and chapati cost around 800 for two peopleFood is spicy with great flavours. Good quantity on decent prices. Not enough choices with sweet dish. Dastaan experimented with regular serving sweet dishes. Like gulabjamun with hot rabri. Paan ice-cream.Beverages - alcoholic and non-alcoholic have same situation here as of sweet dishes. Shakes are also available. If you love trying new things this is a place to visit.Dastaan welcome you with golgappe. As the name suggest they love folk culture - in food and music. Food is in variety - Indian, continental, Chinese, Italian etc, and experimented as well.",2
"I went to this place for dinner and we were 2 people. So we ordered cream of broccoli soup which was actually very good. I ordered Indiana mocktail that was amazing again. We had falafel chat but the only sad part about is that falafel was dry , it could have been more moist . In the main course we had lachha parantha which was really good and we had Moroccan paneer which was actually sweet but in the menu it was written it‚Äôs their take on Kadhai paneer which actually is a bit spicy. So that was a bummer. And I found the service a bit slow. Overall a decent place for family dinner or with friends or loved ones.",2
"Good food, good service and good ambience. No complaints. There was live music as well when we visited.",2
Aman delivered such a service that it made our dining experience worthwhile. The food and drinks are worth the money. We were even given complimentary Gol Gappa shots. Amazing ambience. A must visit.,2
A nice place for fine dining. Good range for both veg and non veg food. We tried different soups and all very really good. The sitting area ambience is nice. Washrooms were clean and maintained too. Prices are reasonable according to the place and quality.,2
"Our friends took us out for a meal to Dastaan.The restaurant is very tastefully designed and very spacious.We had drinks and snacks. The hummus and mutton, chicken tikka and grilled paneer on satay stick were excellent.Service was great and team was very courteous.Enjoyed a lovely evening !",2
"Excellent ambience with an exotic serving style of adding the gravy on the table, is the Dastaan of this eatery. With 2 areas for seating: the outer one with regular restaurant seating with the bar area & the inner one with lounge seating & live performance for a relaxed meal.The deserts too have a similar serving style & all the portions are in good quantity.",2
"I had a good time at Dastaan. Wanted to visit here since a long time and finally got a reservation. The ambience is very good. Nice decor and quiet atmosphere. The paneer tikka and mushroom starters were very soft, succulent and delicious. The aam panna tasted good. Complimentary pani puri shots were best. The black charcoal roti tasted good and so was the chilli cheese garlic naan. The cranberry koftas were ok ok. The portion size is average in all the dishes. The aam panna gin cocktail was also decent. Not too great for alcohol lovers though, tastewise. The mix veg platter main course dish portion size was good.Overall a good experience.",2
"Dastaan is one of my most favourite places in Chandigarh. If I want to eat good flavourful Indian food with a spin of creativity to it only this place would come to my mind üòçThe place has got a very beautiful set up with options of both indoor and outdoor seating. And since it's so spacious it's good to go out for a lunch date since social distancing can be well maintained!Their food quality is absolutely impeccable and every bite is a delight! I've had almost all the veg options from their menu so that says alot about the place üòÅI recently visited them after the lock down and relished some of my favourite food over here-üç¥Starters-  Soya chaap ke kebab and a dish with stuffed mushroomsüç¥Main course - Birbali Kofta with Makhani Gravy (Must Tryüåü) with chilli cheese garlic naan and Churi Paranthaüç¥Drinks-  Dolly ( mango and coconut based) , Masakali (Watermelon and Mint based)üç¥Dessert- Low-key  Phirni (Mango caviar and elaichi flavoured) (Must tryüåü)I love this place and I can never find a replacement for this one ‚ù§Ô∏èHighly Recommend it üåü",2
"Loved this place for its service,food & ambiance. Must try Dal dastaani & paneer Shahi Patiala. I am sure u guys will love it.",2
Must visit restaurant in Chandigarh!The atmosphere is great and the food is out of the world!Especially recommend the Bharwan Jacket Potatoes with gravy!,2
"Beautiful fusion of food and ambiance.Beautifully curated interiors with handmade paintings, nail art will mesmerise you. Rajasthani folk singers adds to the charm. Lets talk about food now its delicious. Weather it is stuffed mushroom, old style dal makhni, Putu biryani you will going to LOVE it. They have an amazing fusion of Mocktails and cocktails too.Its a family dining place. You will see families coming in group. Overall it will be a wonderful experience for you.",2
"""Dastaan"" located in sector 7 is the nee buzz these days. Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon to grab some snacks.Dastaan means a story and this place itself is no less than a well crafted story.The decor is way classy. They fused modern architecture with traditional decor in a very beautiful manner.Absolutely loved the outdoor seating. The infrastructure gives a very cozy ambience to the place.My order was all on chef's recommendation.One can feel the love and passion with which everything was cooked, plated and served here.My order was as follows.The drinks:*Baraarsi paan*Masakali mocktail*Cold coffeeFollowed by food:*Artichoke gucchi stuffed mushroom*Chicken Biryani aranchini*Wasabi and matured cheddar fih tikka*Chicken tikka bruschettaStarting with the drinks I'll say only one word ""unique""Banarsi paan was delectable. It was one of a kind cooler made perfectly and tasted heavenly. An Indianised mocktail which fuses western concepts of coolers with rich Indian paan flavor.Masakali was on a different platform. Not too sweet with a hint of spicy flavours.Will prefer banaarsi paan over it though.Food was a treat to the eyes and the tastebuds.Artichoke gucchi stuffed mushroom were the best for me. Well flavoured and stuffed with flavourful fillings.The creamy texture was a bonus.The chicken biryani aranchini were the next best thing.Evenly cooked with a cheesy core; they were great!I was really impressed by their beautiful interiors and especially by their outdoor seating.The service was quick, respectful and really appreciable.Hope to visit soon again",2
"Good Ambience. Nice Service. Brilliant Taste.
All under one roof. A combination of fine dining and a great restrobar not a brewery though but is a restropub ~ live music.",2
"Visited the restaurant for the first time and the place was recommended by a friend. Reached around 10:35 pm and ordered food. The steward was in a hurry to take the order which was not welcoming at all, may be they have their last order for the day at 11 pm, I think there is a better way of saying it.The washroom at that hour was dirty.Food ordered was served right.Would certainly not recommend anyone to visit this restaurant after 10 pm.And definitely would request the manager and owner to train their staff on people skills and hospitality.",0
A lovely place to hang out with your family and loved ones. Food was delicious and service was fast. Staff was friendly. Overall good vibes and food!,2
"Visited Daastaan twice in last fortnight.The place has a great ambience, is spacious with both alternative to dine out or in.The food is exotic both veg and non veg, presentation impeccable with on the house golgappas in the evening. They have good selection of mocktail/ cocktails and yummy desserts. The place is a must visit if you are in Chandigarh",2
"Great ambiance! Great service! Great taste! Even live flute performance was amazing üíØ
There were so many new dishes to taste though waited for a long time for our table due to huge crowd but still it worth",2
"Subtle , well lit and designed restaurant. Perfect for a silent date night or even an outing with family. Their walnut morrocon chicken/paneer gravy is something that will leave you wanting to come back everytime!",2
Good ambience but food is pricey and quantity is less. Not value for money and food is ok not great. No wow factor,0
Really Nice AmbienceFood is also very nice and the dishes were very creative and tastyExceptDahi kebabs it was horrible other than that we've ordered 4 items those were superb üòçüëåüëåVibe of the place is very good. Highly recommended,2
Had celebrated my birthday here with family. However the service was super poor the waiters were too busy gossiping rather than taking care of the guests. Food is average some how over hyped. Washrooms were not maintained and nor was there enough ventilation. Would recommend not to visit if you are looking for and occasion.,0
"Dastaan is one of the good restaurants in chandigarh.I recently visited this during India visit.Food is relishing. They serve golgappa as starters.With drinks they serve masala peanuts. Very spicy, had to ask for normal peanuts.Service is little slow, if you need a refill you will have to ask for that.Ambience is very nice.Washroom is small and little cleanliness is required.",2
Amazing food..especially the chicken tacos and bruschetta..also don't forget to try the amazing variety of mocktails..Dolly and Bubbly are my personal favouritesüòä,2
Had dinner here last night. Fusion items are worth trying. Ambience is amazing. A bit costly considering the potion sizes of the items,2
"It's always the great experience, staff is very cooperative and the food tastes yummm",2
"Dastaan restaurant is very well known for its authentic Indian and Mughlai cuisine which is presented in a unique way, playing with a combination of flavors and textures. With an upscale ambience, modish decors, and scrumptious food, it is one of the best restaurants near Chandigarh for family dining, and get a chance to experience a live performance by Rajasthani Group.Must Try- Palak Paneer Spanakopitas, Butter Chicken and Mutton Berry pulao",2
It's nicely decorated in the modern cafe style. Offers some unique food combinations like Calcutta style rice noodles & soya kheema with karela. But soup & starter portions were quite small. The place also needs better ventilation.,1
Last night went there with friends . Food was average as compared to the price charged . A high need to improve food experience by Dastaan. Ambience is fine but it's not of much use when the food isn't great....,0
"Great service thank to Dastaan
Make my Evening super....",2
"Nice place, liked the ambience. Interesting food presentation, but the overall taste did not match up. Decently priced though, and the staff is very friendly and helpful.",2
Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere.My recommendation- Fish Ajwaini- Paneer tacos- Gin panna,2
Awesome place. Great ambience. Food is really good and so do service. Initially I thought they will take 15-20 minutes but service was really quick. Wonderful place for dining..,2
Amazing experience. Such a pretty place. Food was delicious. Ambience is really gud. Staff was courteous and kind. Must visit,2
A lovely place for romantic dates with great ambiance and lip smacking north Indian food. The live rajasthani folk music was cheery on top.Loved it.,2
"Really great for date night! We sat in the back, and there was live music when we were there!
We tried going there again but the times online were incorrect, so double check the time if you‚Äôre going for a late dinner.",2
We happened to eat there by chance as the neighborhood restaurants were very loud and crowded..But to our surprise this place was better than what we expected.From food to staff to lighting everything is top notch.Excellent place to enjoy with friends and family.,2
"Elite food served by curtious staff in premium ambience while playing live flute. Charcoal roti was special highlight. A must visit destination in Chandigarh. Pre-booking is must, its always full. Food is super awesome, every item was made by experienced hands with love and care.",2
"Ambience is good. Great for family. Food taste could be improved. I ordered veg/nonveg items but i dont find anything which is like ""Wao..."".",1
"Worst thing about this place is even RO water has chlorine flavour and even the high priced ‚Çπ116 mineral water doesn't taste good and not cold enough. Light is boring, kinda sad. Staffs are like bots. It's a north Indian restaurant but they play Jazz in music.. too boring. Too heavy utensils.. Paid the bill twice and they took 2 weeks to refund money..üëé",0
We tried shitake wild mushrooms and daal tadka with rice and tandoori roti. It was phenomenal.,2
Attendent(s) at entry gate/ reservation counter needs some serious lessons on hospitality as well as manner to behave with guests.,2
"The worst place i have ever been to , nothing special about the food . The service was extremely pathetic. Totally not worth the hype . Pls save your money and time.",0
"Dear Ajay ji and Dastan team,Thank you so much for the lovely hospitality shown by you and ur staff  last night at my family dinner in ur restaurant. We really appreciate the unique blend of taste and fusion of the food served and especially the complimentary golgappa shots.Regards. Manish Gupta",2
"Ordered Chicken arabiatta, Puttu Veg Biryani, Tandoori Roti, Butter chicken and a mango peach ice tea. Taste was great for all items except for the butter chicken. It wasn‚Äôt worth 555‚Çπ for 4 medium pieces of chicken. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2
"Every time I have come here, the food quality is consistently high..excellent service and ambience..fine Indian dining at its best and innovative deconstructed approach..must visit",2
"Food quality and taste was so good that I keep visiting this restaurant again and again.
Love the ambiance as well.",2
"It‚Äôs usually quite busy on weekends and I always wondered what‚Äôs all the fuss about. Trust me‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing. They are below average in food and I would say, you can get better food anywhere in tricity at half the price you pay here.",0
Good twist in the typical Indian cuisine. Nice ambiance! First time in my life I have liked Indian vegetarian food so much. Their spinach koftas in main course ( can‚Äôt remember the dish name) were really good.,2
"Amazing dining experience, a good place for dinner with family. Special mention to vikas Chauhan, very amazing service.",2
"The Best restaurant in Chandigarh Area!Staff and sitting environment was superb,Food was delicious ü§§ quality number one ‚òùüèºplus they play live music except monday.Every penny spent worth it‚úäüèºParking available for Rs 14Highly recommended",2
"A really decent place to go out with family or friends.You can enjoy tranquil environment here and they serve everything in so perfect manner.However i feel the variety of food is less but taste of food is pretty good.
Soo its one of the favourite place for go out dinning.",2
A perfect blend of ambiance and delectable cuisine makes this fine dining restaurant a must-visit for food enthusiasts seeking a truly satisfying meal.,2
"We went with family and it was a great experience for everyone. Ambience and food was great. In live music, musician was playing tabla and flute so it was peaceful.  In non veg try their asian chilli tangri kabab and In veg dal makhani was yummy..",2
Great ambience with great food quality. It's a little bit on the costly side but delicious. Staff was well mannered but the service was a little slow. Overall I loved the place.,2
The service is slow. The food is average. Visited with high hopes (saw the Positive reviews) but family was disappointed.,0
Their paneer snacks are amazing. We didn‚Äôt like one of the other snacks but the chef was really kind to replace it with something tastier. ‚ÄòMaanga‚Äô i. e. ‚ÄòAam panna‚Äô served in earthen pot is the best mock-tail you can have here. Worth a try!,2

Ambience : 5Cleanliness: 5Service : 4Food : 3Drinks : 2Dastaan is a hidden gem in Chandigarh with great vibe and I had fun while I was there.That being said the food is hyped and not at all worth ‚Çπ400-450/- per dish (non-veg).The drinks have packaged fruit juices added to them which is off putting.But the live Rajasthani music üéµ of traditional Ravanahatha just won it for me.Would like to visit again to try something different from the menu.,1
I've loved this place since I moved to Chandigarh. Crazy fusion food and Superb ambience. A definite go to for mughlai and Arabic fusion food.,2
"Loved the ambiance and the service.The way they guided me with the menu, to cleanliness, good options and most important taste and quality was great!I had ordered Dolly mocktail and butter naan with paneer curry.. which had walnuts in it...",2
Hi tea Menu for Dastaan is ‚ù§Ô∏è Must try,2
Their north Indian food is just amazing ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,2
A wonderful curated menu. Food was very good. I suggest going with multiple people so that you can taste many dishes. The portion size is quite good.Polite staff. The lady at the reception desk noticed that I had left my handbag on the sofa and came to hand it over to me outside the restaurant. Thank you for the experience. Definitely coming back here whenever I am in Chandigarh next.,2
"Great! Shaandaar ,jabrdast, Zindabaad.. Bhut e pyaari sitting and dinner try its panner, dal makhani, mojito and That Rajasthani folks. Please reserve a table before going to it..its amazing place for family dinner and easily affordable.i have already come 3 to 4 times and everytime its the beessttt.",2
"10th March, 2022

Visited few days back. The quality isn't the same. It is an okayish experience now.",2
Best place to have some super yummy food! Everything they make is awesome,2
We went for a family dinner. I ordered some paneer. It was the softest paneer ever. That's it. The 10 other things I ordered were super average in taste. The good looked good though and the ambience is also good.,0
The best place to go if you want to have good Indian food. Nobody gets close to these guys. You might find them a lil expensive but its worth the shot. Will definitely recommend everyone.,2
Good food and nice ambience .a must place to try,2
"Food was delicious and tasty.
Service is super fast
Ambiance is good.",2
A very impressive place considering the interiors and matches the expectations with exquisite food quality too. Provided us with a dining experience and amazing service. Definitely recommended.,2
A place with appealing ambiance n good food.  The menu contains lesser of tradional Indian food.  I loved there Dhokla Chat.  Service is excellent.,2
"Good ambience, food is good, crowd is less. If u want a place to talk or just have a good dinner it suits the bill",2
A surreal place with amazing food. I got new palate of taste in every dish served.,2
"Loved the ambience and food. We have pre-informed them for my mother's birthday celebration and it was all nicely managed.
The Rajasthani music added more colors to the place.",2
"The ambiance is good but the food served here isn't up to the mark in terms of taste. Starters were average, lunch was ok however   the drinks served were pretty good. If you love Chinese starters this isn't a place for you.Prices are quite high.Entrance is not so impressive to the the restaurant.You can visit once but I don't think one should really revisit this place as there are many options available in sector 7 & 26.",1
"I cannot begin to describe how much we loved this place when we visited Chandigarh for a few days. The first time we went it was so good that we came back a second time before we left. The food is absolutely incredible and very reasonably priced.The customer service is excellent! You can definitely tell they care about customers and offering them a nice experience. We tried all sorts of food, honestly, anything on the menu will be delicious!On our second night here we also got to have dinner with a live music show! It was absolutely brilliant!10/10 place! I absolutely recommend it!",2
"Absolutely Gastronomic experience! It's nice (and otherworldly) to see restaurant staff actually committed to making sure that you have a great experience!Ricotta dahi kebab is wild!Make sure to have the Anardana served with the bill; that completes the 'gastronomic' part!Highly recommended!Parking: Plenty of free parking right next to mall entrance, considering mall security is at the same spot - so the outside parking next to gate is reasonably safe!",2
One the great places to go out. Food is great. The ambiance is great..,2
"I really don't know why this restaurant has 4.7 rating. I have ordered 2 dishes 1 mocktail.1. Chilli paneer 4/10 ( I can make better then this for sure)2. Noodles 6/10 (It were chilli garlic 2 pieces of chilli's in there makes it chilli garlic)3. Fresh orange something .1/10 (Filled with Real juice that was pathetic)I'll rate 2/10 and that too only for ambience and staff otherwise it should be 1/10.Thanks, will never come here or will suggest overpriced,  overhyped. I can guarantee you can make food better then this thanks.",0
It's just the hype. The quality of food isn't up to the mark and also it's quite EXPENSIVE.2* for service and good beverages.,0
"Anardana restaurant is definitely one of best restaurant in the industrial area. Located in City Emporium mall on ground floor. Great ambience and atmosphere with music. Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian options available with snacks, main course and drinks including alcohol. Service was very good and fast. Family restaurant which can also be reserved for parties and meetings. Easy to get a table on weekends too. A bit expensive, but the quantity and quality of food makes up for it. Only thing to point out was food served was a little bit cold and drinks were not as cold as they were supposed to be. Overall, a great experience and would definitely visit againParking: Mall usually remains empty so plenty of underground parking space at Rs 40 per vehicleWheelchair accessibility: Elevators and lifts present inside the mall for access to Anardana Restaurant",2
Loved the environment and non veg food. One of the best Chiken with Butter Naan tasted till now. Rest in comparison to top restaurants also the prices seemed to be high. Service was also OK. Overall a nice place u can come at any special event. On my second visit I tasted their Paneer Tikka Butter Masala with Garlic Naan and Roti. I really enjoy it. The one time can serve two people only which is quite expensive for a sometime visits but the quality was up to mark.,2
"Looking for fine and luxury dining?Then this place is a must must Visit for family gatherings!Recently they have launched their lunch buffet in which they serve 4-5 starters, good options in main course, and delicious desserts!The vibe is amazing, staff is polite and courageous!Overall the experience is good",2
Great hospitality by Mr. Aman. Warm hospitality. Love to visit again also recommend to our friends and family. Keep it up. Best of luck !!!Vegetarian options: Delicious veg food and presentation,2
"Recently I make a visit here with my friend because someone suggested me this place. So last Monday I decided to visit here in afternoon to had a lunch. First thing First such a classy and beautiful place it is. With unique type of ambiance and great fusion of flavourful food. I shared some pictures of interior and food trust me guys I have zero complaints with there food. Moreover, staff was very polite and suggested us very good drinks, food and dessert. Service was quite quick just tell them what you want to eat or drink they provide as per your time. We started with Mocktails and Cocktails which was quite good, after that we order some snacks and then Main course and at the end dessert. I like the presentation of food and the Mocktails and Cocktails.Last but not least, if someone is visiting here please its humble request from our side please do not make any order of dessert from here one will disappoint with that. Just dessert was not good, but overall dining experience was 5 out of 5. And yes it is quite expensive but very single penny will satisfied your taste buds.We recommend you all just for a once make a visit here.

"Ambience was so good and the music collection, apt as per environment...food was too good..Pina collada is the best..need little improvement in sizzlers and please expand your salad variety...overall it was nice..Vegetarian options: Less veg options in salad and sizzlers.Parking: Paid parking in the mall premisesKid-friendliness: Plenty of space with good soft music",2
"We always wanted to try out Anardana in Delhi NCR but we finally got an opportunity on our way from Chandigarh to try this gem out. We had always heard great about this place and really wanted to give this one a try.The place is simply beautiful with vibrant interiors, a lavish bar and an exquisite d√©cor. We started our lunch with chaat papdi slider and moved on to butter chicken and assorted breads. The food was utterly scrumptious and was perfect on every aspect, be it the taste, or the flavor or aroma or presentation. The only concern we felt was the quantity which we felt could be a slight more.All in all we had a great experience and will definitely visit the other branches too.Cheers ;)",2
"Excellent place for dine in. We had our dinner at this restaurant. It's at the ground floor. Service is quick and staff is courteous.Butter chicken, Dal and papdi chaat is awesome.Good selection of Scotch as well.Biggest negative is the live music, it's very loud. Difficult to talk...!! So much so that after placing the order we stood outside till our order was served.",2
"It is an authentic place for fine dining. This place is a good combination of delicious food, great ambience and good service. Must try dal makhni. Though the prices are on the higher side but worth. Must visit. They also play live music after 8pm.Kid-friendliness: Good but live music is loud after 8. So, go with your kids accordingly",2
"Everything is pretty good about this place! The moment you enter Anardana, you will experience great vibes. Interiors and ambience are intricately designed with every corner offering a different atmosphere. Staff is very polite and often ask you about taste, salt, spice and other things. Their food is just the best in Tricity, so fresh, so pure in taste! Must try their Veg Kebab Platter, Dal Makhni, Paneer Tikkar Butter Masala and Soya Champ along with Cheeze naan, Kandhari naan and Garlic coriander naan.Mocktails are very different and unique from any other place!Overall 5/5Hygeine 5/5Ambience 5/5Hospitality 5/5Must visit if you are in Tricity!!",2
Great vibes.. Good music and ambience.. Food was very tasty especially Beetroot kebab and Malai Kofta. Staff was very prompt and courteous.,2
"I have booked a deal from Swiggy for anardana, upon arrival the girl standing at door gave us very strange look when we told we hv booking from swiggy, while entering the restaurant she told the hotel staff ""ye swiggy deal vale h"" in very awkward manner. Later that staff hasn't treated us well his attitude towards us is like as if we are here for free food. Very much disappointed with service and attitude.Secondly I hv visited this place many times in past and hosted 2 corporate dinners/lunch and at that times we were treated well but today the behaviour of staff was very rude. Also today quantity of the dishes were also less as compared to earlier visits.Dear anardana,it was you and swiggy who shared the deal, we didn't came begging to you for discount.Very much disappointed with service and food quality.You lost one of the loyal customer once for all.",0
"The ambiance is great, they greet you well while entering and accompany you to your table to give you a good feeling about their hospitality, the food on the other hand I will say is kind of okayish. Some of the things are extra ordinarily good and some are just up to the mark, the quantity of the items can be worked upon as the quantity was a little on the lesser side.Everything said above was somewhat the same on my repeat visit, however I think the service needs to be improved as it seems to be declining.",2
"Thank you to Trip Advisor otherwise I couldn‚Äôt have found this place.  Reserving a table with Khem was so simple and welcoming. He greeted us on entrance,‚Äù I was waiting for you only‚Äù‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what hospitality is all about ‚Ä¶. Right üòä? From there Amit took over. We asked so many questions and he was very patient to listen and enthusiastic answered all our queries.Drinks: Three cocktails, one mocktail,  everyone enjoyed their drinks. I asked a second for ‚ÄòSomething Indian‚Äô. It beats the usual mojito. The talented bartender has put the best in every drink.Food: we ordered bunch of appetisers. The ‚Äòchicken chat salad‚Äô was a hit, and the ‚Äòdahi kebab‚Äô was equally delicious. Amritsari fish and pan fried momos served with dipping sauce; our tastebuds enjoyed these too. In mains we ordered chicken biryani served with yogurt and some sauce. Very nicely prepared and served in a beautiful dish. Oh! And the best is their ‚ÄòMango chutney‚Äô that reminded me of my mom‚Äôs recipe üòã  !Thank you team for a wonderful experience.",2
"Overall experience amezing .Friendly staff, tasty food, amezing vibeThe one thing disappointed me is that washroom was not clean..i know it is hard to check restroom everytime..but you can add some written guidelines in washrooms about flush and maintain the cleanliness..",2
"Amazing dining experienceüòã. Beautifully designed and the plants was giving the good vibes to the place.üî∏Staff - The staff were humble, polite and well dressed. The service is great and no delay.üî∏Food - The food was mouthwatering. We started with few mocktails and then the Veg platter and the main course. I like the presentation of food and the mocktails.Just the dessert was not great but overall dining experience is 10 out of 10.",2
"First and foremost: Fantastic Atmosphere.Food that is delicious. (Try any of the menu items! It's well worth it.)Excellent customer service.All of them were good, but the cocktails and mocktails were terrible. They didn't mix it properly, and they also didn't serve it properly.Our Orders:Jasmine Ice Tea - Literally felt like nimbupaniJ√§gerbomb - Not at all in proper portionsMoscow Mule - was lemon juice and vodkaCaramel Salt Shake - Sweet Milk",1
"There are very few instances where you tend to visit a place that is 10/10 on all aspects. One such place in the city has to be Anardana Kitchen.I went here one fine day to give their food a shot and, oh my, I was seriously blown away by their service and food.The moment you enter the restaurant, you can expect a courteous staff who will guide you to the seating area. It is a very well-lit setup with beautiful lighting and a comfortable, laid-back seating option.Coming to the beverages section, they have an ongoing Sangria and Cocktail festival. I had their Anardana Tangy LIIT and Strawberry Lemonade Sangria. Both of the drinks were highly refreshing. The Sangria had to be one of my go to drinks with a well balanced blend of red wine, freshly strawberry and lemon juice.For food, I gave a shot to their Spicy Thai Chicken Dimsum, Kung Pao Mushroom, BBQ chicken pizza, Chilli Garlic Noodles and Kung Pao Chicken .Speaking of their dimsums, I would say that they nailed the dish. The very essence of any Thai dish is the use of lemongrass and chilli, both of which were evident in the dimsums. You must try it if you would like to taste these elements.Next up, the Kung Pao Mushroom was well tossed in a thick sauce prepared using the freshest of ingredients. The spice levels of this dish are slightly moderate, so I would recommend this one to all of those who prefer mildly spiced food.The Kung Pao Chicken with Chilli Garlic noodles was a surprise package in itself. Bite-sized boneless pieces of chicken cooked in a thick, nice cashew rich kung pao gravy served with a well seasoned bowl of noodles was a heavenly combination. Simply a delicious preparation.I also tried out their BBQ chicken pizza. The goodness of any dish comes from the sauce, and in this case, the BBQ sauce was on point. The pizza was as good as one could get. Let me tell you another positive about Anardana. They prepare their pizzas over a wood fire, so you can expect a uniform crust with a nice smoky aftertaste.To end things on a sweet note, I tried their Tiramisu. Without saying much, I just dug into the jar and was awestruck with the texture of the Tiramisu overall. I just loved the texture of this classic Italian dessert in every single bite.Thanks to the prompt service provided by the staff, everything went on smoothly. I will surely be visiting them very soon. Happy eating.",2
"The Sangria and Cocktail Fest 2023 held at Anardana is truly an experience to remember. With an array of refreshing cocktails and fruity sangrias, this festival was a paradise for all drink lovers. I was personally blown away by the strawberry sangria which was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy flavors. The old-fashioned cocktail was also a treat to the senses as it was smoked to perfection, adding a unique flavor to the drink.What made this festival even better was the food. The chili garlic noodles paired with mixed vegetables in garlic sauce were exceptional. The Ambala chicken was a standout dish that melted in my mouth, and the tiramisu was the perfect dessert to end my meal. The food at Anardana is a must-try.The Sangria and Cocktail Fest 2023 is perfect for a day out with friends and family. The festival offers unlimited drinks for just 1100 rupees for two hours, from Monday to Friday, 12 to 6 pm, till 31st March. The ambiance at Anardana is perfect for a fun and relaxed day out.Overall, I would highly recommend this festival to anyone who loves a good drink and delicious food. The Sangria and Cocktail Fest 2023 at Anardana is an event not to be missed!",2
This place is heaven for food and drink.We ordered galauti kabab which was mouthwatering.Chicken chilly again was very crisp and flavour full.Butter chicken and Naan was tasty .Must visit place if you are in Chandigarh.,2

"The service was quick.
The ambience was very pretty and the food also tasted good!!
Highly Recommended...",2
"The ambience and arrangement is good. The food tastes okay. The staff is not very much trained. The prices are high if you compare the taste and quantity.
Its a one time visit place, as per my view and the view of the group with whom I visited the place.",1
Tried the whole new purani Delhi kah Chatpata khanaDahi Bhalla is amazingI tried mango lassi which was a must tryThe service is amazing tooIn love with the ambience with a good vibeA family restaurant with amazing foodWould visit more often with familyThe quality and quantity is perfectI prefer to visit this place instead of Goin for buffet,2
Restaurant staff keeps staring at you... Which made me conscious and uncomfortable.. the only negative thing about the place.Service was prompt.... Ambience was awesome and food was divine!!,2
"The first impression was wow. When we entered we like the overall atmosphere and interior. We asked about buffet and started enjoying the foods and drinks. In buffet there were only one drink which is something like lime soda. The issue was, they given all the foods altogether. We ordered three buffet, two non-veg and one veg. And they given everything in one go. There were no way to eat everything altogether. So what happened is food getting cold and no way to eat that. Then we asked for one item to repeat which took almost 30 mins. After complaining to manager he told he will replace everything but we wanted to go home as we were on schedule. Food quality was good, no complaints regarding food and atmosphere just serving methods needs improvement. They should give enough food in one time and serve rest in multiple time. That was people can enjoy every single items and bite. Overall experience was okay with little hiccups. I‚Äôll definitely try again after few days. üòä",2
The ambiance was nice and the food was delicious. Worth visiting üòâ,2
"We were there for my parents‚Äô anniversary and it turned out to be great! The food and drinks were both delicious, the place has great music and the service was excellent too! Gaurav helped suggest some of their best sellers which turned out to be a hit with everyone! We had a great time!",2
"To start with , ambience was really good . Good menu layout ,Ordered Black garlic chicken and veg mushroom for the starters . Kids really enjoyed the mushroom and the chicken was amazing on other hand .  For main course we just ordered butter chicken and dal makhni and nan , superb taste .Service was awesome and our server MR . Nahim was really amazing .Thank you Anardana for making our special day worth it to visit you.Kudos , keep up the good work .Vegetarian options: For a change veg options were also lip smacking..",2
This place is a hidden gem of the Tricity located in the city emporium mall. The food is really good! The presentation is just amazing and the even the staff is really polite. But the service is a bit slow. Rest everything is perfect. Reshmi Chicken Tikka is a must must try for non vegetarians and Dahi ke kebab for vegetarians. Even the main course is lip smacking. Just need to buckle up on the service part rest everything is perfect,2
"was very curious whether our experience will be good or not. but as soon as i entered in Anardana, i knew it was my right decision to spend some good quality family time. There food is just so tasty and very expressive. I ordered Manchow Soup, Hara Bhara Kabab Platter, Tomato Soup , Dal Makhni , Paneer Tikka Butter Masala & Garlic Naan. I have to say that not even a single item was disappointing. Everything was just perfect.P.S. - Also the dineout offer available on the app is working fine and i got fancy discount on my invoice.I recommend this resturant to everyone who is looking to spend some quality time with family.5 out of 5 stars.all ‚ù§Ô∏èvasu",2

Lovely dinning experience. Pre-booking is preferred as the place gets filled easily and very quickly. Pick almost anything on the menu and they won't disappoint.Pro tip: Look out for coupons. Will help you settle the bill without weighing heavy on your pocket.,2
"Anardana, the place did just to its name being sour, tangy and just aptü§§...The first dish I tried left me with that crisp nature, for ages to comeü§™, being 'pan friedpaneer'The next dish being Mushroom and cheese rolls were disappointing as i could hardly see any cheese in it, and a bit overpriced‚úåüèªThe veg platter that came next had a striking presentation with paneer tikka and seekh kebab being my favouriteü§©But dish that I could kill for was the momos platter with 4 varieties, deep fried momos being the bestThe sweet dishes came next, anardana chocolate candy bomb really being the bomb and a chocolate brownie with ice-cream(brownie being the average).Mr. Sumit took a genuine feedback from me and i hope they could work on the rolls and brownie‚úåOverall, my experience was really good and i loved the mocktails over there!",2
The first thing I noticed were the interiors. Very well decorated and spacious. Service was excellent. No complaints. After a long time I found a restaurant that serves amazing veg food. Non-veg food was also good. Overall it's a nice restaurant to visit and has much better food than your average Chandigarh restaurants.I would recommend it for vegetarians especially.,2

Nice place & ambience. Food was awesome.I must say service was very good . I was served by Mr Gaurav and he really took good care of my whole family. Must visit place. Thank you Gaurav ji for ur wonderful service.,2

Nice place & ambience. Drinks are awesome. Food was great. Make sure to do advance booking before you go specially on weekends,2
The only best thing is ambience. The service staff is pathetic. Food is ok but not soo good according to their prices...,1
"Anardane k annar me itna ras nahi hai!I herd alot about about this place and i had a lot of expectations. But very ok type place.- Ambiance it just good only not wow.- Menu food discriptions are good but not the actual food.- Dont try their 'anardana special' special dishes not worth at all.- restraunts owbers should understand 'fancy naam rakhne se khane ka taste wahi rehta.- service was so slow.- food is not worth the price they are offering.- chalo kuch achi baten ab - only thing i loved about the place was the dal and few mocktails that‚Äôs it.- Its a cozy place so good for families.- old bollywood music adding to the vibe.- 20% discounts on fool bill is available on Dineout ,Zomato, Easy dinner.",1
Gaurav was great! He even replaced one of the paneer dishes with other one! Dal makhani was good! Something Indian cocktail is a must have!,2
Anardana offers exceptional value for money. it is very deleicious menu  for pocket ranges. good enviroment .The service at Anardana is impeccable. The staff's attentiveness and genuine . i satisfied loved it ....,2
"Anardana!Looking out for new places opened in the tricity to dine out??! Your search is over..I found this place ideal to dine out with friends, family. The relaxing vibe and soothing music are the great accompaniments to the delicious food served here. The menu has a wide variety. The place has a pretty decor. It will cheer you up before the food does. Their service, presentation of food is all up to the mark. We didn't plan to order much, but gosh, you can't stop. We started with chilli paneer, and Papdi Bruschetta. Loved the flavours and these are good for giving your dining experience at @anardanakitchen a kick start. They will welcome you with welcome drinks but guys don't stop there, they have some pretty mocktails that they serve in their pretty glasses. Will make your day!  Next, we wanted to try gunpowder chicken tikka and yes, these were quite juicy. You should give it a try.The star item for me was the Lebanese platter! I should write it in BOLD to grab your attention. You won't find such beautiful falafel, pita bread, hummus, sour cream, salad , cigar rolls spread anywhere in tricity. I can bet on that. Loved their Falafel, perfect blend of crispy -ness and soft-ness. We didn't had much room left for the mains but still ordered biryani and it was yummy. We had to ask to get it packed for take away and staff politely agreed. In desserts, we had gulabjamun with rabri. Nyom, nyom! Amazing taste at every bite.I would recommend to try this place to give yourself a treat and a day to remember. I would like to say kudos to the whole team for doing such a great work in maintaining the place in such an ideal way and taking care of each and every item they have on their menu with respect to presentation as well as taste.See you again, Anardana !",2
"Recently visited this awesome place and got a chance to have some Delectable Food. The staff and service is upto the mark.We started our meal with Starters. I ordered Stuffed Tandoori Soya Chaap ( this was super good and a must try thing especially for veg peeps ), Gunpowder Chicken Tikka, Kandhari fish tikka. They all tasted so good.Having the drinks I had The Trolling, Imli ka buta ( this was a unique drink of tamarind syrup topped up with soda & lime juice ) and lastly Anardana Pan Ras ( Crushed Pan Parag in spiced soda ) .All the drinks looked great and tasted well.Again the main course was just amazing with Makhmali malai kofta having cottage cheese cooked in rich gravy with pomegranate. Secondly I had Jatt di pasand butter chicken, a cooked boneless chicken in cashew and tomato gravy. I had them with butter naan and Lachha pudina Parantha. I personally loved the lachha pudina paranthaLastly there is always a slot for dessert lol. So I had Anardana Chocolate Candy Bomb which is always a must thing and rated 5/5 . This is chef's special ice cream and chocolate with tangy crushed nachos topping.The presentation of the drinks and dishes makes it stand out of all. Overall an amazing experience.",2
Great ambiance! Great food and great services. Special care was taken by Gaurav! Everything was handled professionally. Quick service and will be here again soon!,2
Customer Service was amazing.Lot of vegetarian food options. Food was very tasty and mocktails were also amazing. Service was very fast.HIGHLY RECOMMEND,2
"A wonderful place with good ambience and smiling people ready to serve you. Starters, fusion drinks, mocktails made a fine start with sushi, platter, Lebanese platter, fried rice, Manchurian, biryani, chana Masada, Hyderabad paneer main course items were yummy. We enjoyed food and plan to visit again.",2
"Food was tasty, mocktails were good, only anardana mocktails was real juice of 250 plus ;) that is not expectable. Overall good experience.",2
"Live music, youthful ambiance, good food and excellent service. Better reserve a table as it gets busy very quickly.Vegetarian options: Kurkura paneer üòãParking: It's in a mall and mall parking bit unorganizedWheelchair accessibility: Lifts are available and the restaurant is on ground level.",2
"Taste - 4/5Portion - 5/5Ambience - 5/5Service - 5/5Value for money - 4/5Serving appetizing north indian,chinese & mughlai, this place is located on the ground floor of city emporium mall.The ambience is alluring. Royal settings, gracious chandeliers, vibrant colours, cozy corners, live music, they have it all.The staff is attentive, informed and makes sure the waiting time is not unfair.Use coupons so that the dining does not burn a hole in your pocket.Menu is designed to add a smile through all the fusion category names.1. Butter chicken penne pasta - 5/5As reluctant as the fusion may sound, the pasta cooked in makhni gravy tasted mouth watering. This fusion is a hit and must try.2. Hara bhara kebab platter - 3/5A whole platter of paneer, mushroom, potatoes, figs and almond kebabs. It had a distinct presentation but tasted a little bland and was on the sweeter side.3. Fusion mocktails - 5/5It's fun to watch them getting made at the live bar. Both (Imli ka buta & Anardana five spicy) tasted true to their names - tangy, spicy and refreshing.4. Chocolate candy bomb - 5/5This chef's special ice cream and muddy chocolate treat topped with tangy crush nachos was the perfect way to end the meal.",2
"Would probably had selected 0 stars, if the option were possible. We had made a reservation through Google and  we expected them to have their booking situation sorted out (like any professional restaurant would have ) specially given that we recieved an email for the booking confirmation. If you don't want to acknowledge booking through Google then why even have a reserve table option there. Ruined our whole evening!",0
It's a Delhi based restaurant that has opened its second branch in Chandigarh recently. Interiors of this place has been done in a very modern way and it builds a great ambience. The delectable food adds a quite happy flavour to the ambience. Must try Mushroom Galouti Kebab's with their special Anardana Chutney. Though Momos platter could have been better.We totally loved the hospitality of the staff. They were very kind to offer us complementary dessert of the birthday occasion. Khoya Samosa was very good and had very unique flavour.,2
The Food here was Awesome.I ordered Chinese here but I am dying for the North Indian dishes would be going there next time for a proper dinner meal.Ordered Momo platter(Veg) came with 3 different sauces mint chutney was superbly going with tandoori momo from the platter and another dish was Manchurian good too.But the Watermelon mocktail(rewash liquid) was superb.The bill came around 1800 for 2 people.,2
Great foodGreat ambienceGreat hospitalityLoved every bit of itHave liked a be restraunt so much after a long time,2
"I loved thiss place and would definitely visit them alot, their ambience was soo soothing for me and the food tasted amazing.. I loved their dal makhani and khoya samosa also their breads were amazing..Also i loved their spicy guava and kala khatta in mocktails..Don't forget to follow ""Khaanjaan5"" On Instagram for drooping food content and honest reviews :)",2
"My recent visit to this newly opened place was surprisingly awesome. It's a beautiful and luxurious place which serves delectable fusion cuisines in a presentable way.I was held spell bound by it's Ambience as once you enter the restaurant, their classic and top class bar will surely caught your eye.Coming to the food, we started our meal with two fabulous drinks Kala khatta and strawberry slush(Must try). We moved on to their classic  Fusion starter - Pan fried chilli paneer and Papdi Bruschetta. In the Main course we had Mutton Biryani, Kadhai Jhinga pahadi Masala(unique and super delicious) accompanied with Garlic Naan.The very unique style of pizza which has a topping of samosa called ""Samosa Pizza"" recommend by their Executive Chef Bharat is totally worth trying.This sweet dish called Chandrakala Khoya Samosa, stuffed with khoya and nuts, served with icecream has all my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è.The staff are polite and very well expertise in their work and I was served by Aarti.",2
"I think 3.5 starts is a right choice.
Place in terms of  ambiance is really very good.
Nom vegetarian food is also good as compared to vegetarian food.
As the name suggests they have a modern names to old school dishes.",2
"I guess, chandigarh finally has a substitute for Swagat restaurant. Anardana is one of the most polished and upscale restaurants in chandigarh, which is surprisingly affordable aswell. We loved our food , loved the service -everything was simply splendid. Thanks to the warm manager Mr.Sumit we got to taste the deserts aswell . I wish the team all the best for this new project and hope that they don't change their menu for atleast 3 years..  Highly recommend the Shahi paneer and dal makhani here .",2
"It is located inside a mall which is still under renovations and not a lot of stores are opened there, making it difficult to reach if one solely depends on local conveyance. One can easily find it on google maps though. Coming to the restaurant, it has been decorated beautifully and hosts live performances as well. Food is good and there is ample seating space.",2
"Music and Food both were great. But of what use if it gets to you after 45minutes of order and too on a non weekend day, when half the tables are empty.ACs too were not working (saving electricity) or not, but it ws really uncomfortable.Frequent light cuts, I had never seen in my life.One good thing they hv done is that they hv trained their waiters to ask for a google 5 star review. So when you see 4.8 rating, pls understand it has nothing to do with any quality.One star, Avoidable, go to Swagath, Chillies or anywhere else and thank me later.",0
"It was great time here. Food, ambience, service was very good, especially Gaurav was superb. Loved it.
Must go‚ù§",2
"Tasty food with unique cocktails. Tried it first time today and the restaurant is actually a hidden gem for Indian food enthusiasts in chandigarh, they also serve Chinese and Cafe food too. The vibe is totally of an international restaurant. Lunch is usually less crowded so the best part is no waiting but quick grub. Keep up the good work. All the stewards and managers on duty were presentable and knowledgeable at least on their menu. See you soon! Cheers",2

It was our Anniversary & we were eating food in Anardana restaurant and during this my baby feels uneasy in breathing as food chocked in his mouth and he vomit there . I clean the sofa which was lil bit dirty and their manager was asking us for 1000 rs for cleaning the floor . When I asked him is this right way thn he said ok give him 500 rs .I was totally disappointed with the manager‚Äôs behaviour as my 4 yrs old baby feels very insecure there and he said mumma will never come to this restaurant again . They spoiled our day .,0

"Initially, I was really sketched out by the general location of the mall. We saw someone get beat up as we were looking for the parking lot entrance. The decor of the restaurant is really nice, not at all like the mall it‚Äôs situated in. One of the glasses was dirty but they provided us with clean glasses on request. In one of the silverware sets, a knife was missing but again they rectified this upon request. We liked the drinks we tried, and out of all the food, we only like the chicken tikka. I had high hopes for the food based on the pictures but the taste was not up to par. It seemed like they were cutting back on quality and taste to deliver the food in a timely manner. The inside of our manchurian was not well cooked, and the batter of fish tikka also wasn‚Äôt fully set.",1
Really loved the place and the hospitality by Gaurav . The food and ambience both are amazing . Would really visit again for the awesome food and vibes .,2

"GT roadis a delightful haven for food enthusiasts. The diverse buffet offers a tantalizing array of scrumptious delicacies, satisfying every palate. The value for money is evident in the generous portions and quality ingredients. The inviting atmosphere adds to the overall experience, making it a must-visit for anyone craving authentic North Indian flavors.Vegetarian options: It's a buffet and they have catered everythingParking: The parking lot is not managed properly they will cut the slip but will not bother if u find the parking.and few cars were parked in 1and half area of XUV i e.

"Restaurant located in sector 26, Chandigarh. Parking space is an issue , especially on weekends, so we took a taxi. Inside the main seating area, the tables are adequately spaciously placed. The interiors are plain looking but does add to the ambience . Alcoholic/non alcoholic beverages are available. Variety in veg and non veg eats is observed, as for the starters, main course as well as the dessert. Service to table in general is responsive, however, one particular snack was served cold and the Air conditioner vent directly above our seating was dripping water, which dampened the taste a wee bit.Overall a good experience. Foll are my ratings:Place of eatery - 7/10Variety in food and drink - 9/10Service response - 8/10Taste of food - 8/10Value for money spent - 7/10",2
"Buffet menu with loads of options. However, nothing clicked our taste buds. In comparison to other Buffet serving restaurants, spread is certainly better but taste is missing. Atmosphere is better than others.",1
"I visited this place to celebrate a birthday n we were totally disappointed with the level of service n poor taste of food here. The veg buffet cost us approx ‚Çπ1050/- per person, which is not cheap by any means. They served us a few snacks n then deliberately stopped service for the next 15 minutes on our table. I am using the word deliberately after due diligence n my keen observation. They did the same thing with almost all the tables. Serve a few items then wait for a few minute before serving the next round. In that much time a person will automatically feel satiated n the restaurant will save on its costs. After snacks we tasted the soup n food n 3 items including the soup, dal n paneer had loads of salt, so much so that it was impossible to eat. We complained to the manager n chef n they offered to cook fresh for us but we had no intention or appetite to eat more.Overall it was very disappointing for us as food should have been up to the mark. And being a Wednesday it wasn't the peak time for justifying such negligence. They must pay attention to this crucial aspect of their business for their own good.",0
Ambience is awesome but variety was less comparatively ABs and Barbeque Nation overall place is very live and crowded always..taste is also good ..price is little on higher side 1100 around,2
It was awesome experience when we visited this place . We been there with our friends from UK and they really loved the food here . Honestly food was good and ambience is also very good and the staff os very polite .,2
It is a very good hotel and the service of the waiter is very good & every type of food available there,2
"It‚Äôs a good place to go with friends and familyAll good food, staff service and ambiance too. They change some part of their menu every time so whenever you go will find something new along with their fixed menu. Cocktails are also must try. Food is decent menu is not too vast to get confused.Specifically the deserts are to die for, they serve small portions of everything so that you can enjoy everything without getting confused and also without wasting food.Staff is very nice they ask to repeat things if needed and serve it as quickly as possible.You will not time to take breathe while eating it‚Äôs always something in your plate.Starters and desserts are the best thing.",2
"If you are a big foodie u have to love GT Road‚Ä¶. They have one of the best buffets available. Freshly made non veg buffet is to die for.. splly the fish & prawns. And never ever miss the pineapple üççtikka . U will keep asking for more..
also do try their quirky & tasty mocktails & cocktails.",2
"Visited this place on a friend‚Äôs recommendation, place gives a good first impression, its a big restaurant having 100+ sitting capacity ,staff is attentive and courteous, there spread is not that lavish as compared to Absolute barbecue or Barbecue Nation but however they do give a lot of importance to the ambiance, you will get a good traditional vibes here, they use really nice and heavy cutlery, as far as food is concerned , excellent street food but okayish tikkas and other snacks , Main course spread and dessert section is also limited and something which they need to work is the narrow passage where the buffet is spread , it gets really crowded and is time consuming.",2
For a change a better option other than barbecue nation .Food stands fantastic and ambience is too good.Can be good option for both family friends if we are planning for buffet dinner.At the end the antique way of serving things and the theme based setup is mind boggling .,2
"All good, very tasty food and a nice variety of food options available for vegetarian and non-vegetarian people.",2
"Very good ambience and quality food. A wide variety of starters with barbecue on your table added flavor. A prompt service with always ready approach of staff was plus point. Missing was welcome drink which was offered later. There was good choice of veg and non veg food with salad. I being vegetarian opted for vegetarian food which was tasty. In the end a variety of ice creams, tarts, kulfi, bakery products made the visit memorable. They have good food and ambience and gives a soothing experience.",2
"The best place in ""All you can eat buffet"" category.Always crowded. Wait time is high but the place is worth it!Ambience: 4Excellent interior, and lighting. My only concern was the loud music. Good for larger group of family and friends.Food : 5Variety of starters and desserts.Pricing: 4Expensive. Worth it if you are really hungry! üòÑ",2
Really good food & good ambience‚Ä¶.the service is also very good,2
Had a wonderful experience visiting with friends for team lunch. Food variety & quality is excellent. There is open buffet with snack served on table. Food was very tasty and served hot. Staff is very courteous. Sufficient parking space is available which is paid. Only concern is limited washrooms as compared to sitting space so there can be waiting.,2
Indian cuisine is goodCleanVery congested in terms of sitting area and buffet area movementsPoor space managementExtra sized menu but very superficial tastes..,2
Awsome food quality and biggest buffet ever I seen in Chandigarh. Lots of variety and amazing taste. Amazing interior as well. For me it‚Äôs best buffet in barbecue pattern.,2
"We celebrated our new year eve at this place. And undoubtedly found it really welcoming and warm. Though we had to wait for 30 mins to get access to the restaurant (of course due to new year celebrations) and the service was slow due to obvious reasons, but to be honest, the staff is way too cooperative and Amicable. The starter and main course both were well prepared indeed. Also the atmosphere of this place is very vibrant and full of festivity. It is actually a good place both for family and friends. Thank you for sucha nice evening! üòä Cheers!  ü•Ç",2
"Place is fine...food is good. But staff seems to be not interested in doing their job, all looks bit lost and do not respond appropriately. Otherwise recommended for ambiance and food only.",2
"Located in Sector 26 Chandigarh, takes you to an exquisite food journey inspired from the 2600 km course of the Grand Trunk road. This restaurant is itself a museum which showcases a glimpse of our heritage. It focuses on providing a royal buffet experience at an affordable price. With vintage interiors and pleasant ambiance, this restaurant surely has a charm to it. From my recent visit here, I have sifted a must try preparations from their exemplary menu which also happens to be my personal favorites.1. COCKTAILS- If you adore fancy drinks with your food, you should definitely try their cocktails. Not just a fancy appearance but tastes equally good. The preparation style is brilliant.2. SERVED ON TABLE APPETIZERS- Buffet places are known for their barbeque appetizers but here the on table served appetizers outshined for me. Roasted pineapple, chicken lollipop, chicken burrah, salsa potatoes and raj kachori are some outstanding options to try.3. CHICKEN LEMON CORIANDER SOUP- With mild citrusy notes, the soup is refreshing and light.4. MAINCOURSE- Anda curry and soya chaap butter masala are two unexpected dishes on this list but the flavors are bang on!!5. DESSERTS- With a significantly large corner dedicated for desserts, it becomes very difficult to taste all of them. Their extra special will be the super creamy paan ice-cream and pista kulfi. Heavenly!!Cost for 2- Rupees 3000 approx. (Alcohol included)Keep supporting @Iconnectwithfood on IG.Vegetarian options: A wide variety of vegetarian options that are absolutely delicious, available too. ",2
"I had gone to this place with some expectations, supposedly the place had good food and good atmosphere. The actual experience was very different. Like most of the newly opened eating places in Chandigarh the emphasis is mostly on the concept rather than the food.The design of the place is overdone with too many clashing elements trying to catch your eye. The eating utensils seem far from clean as the material is copper and some yellow metal is used for the cutlery which looks pretty unhygienic.The less said about the food the better. The concept is copied from Barbecue Nation but that is where the comparison ends. Though the menu is very varied but the taste leaves a lot to be desired. The portions are very small and the taste not that good.On the whole not a place I would like to visit again, even though the Chef promised me a much better experience the next time.",0
"Honestly I had an amazing experience . there was so many types of starters and main course and deserts. .And what I like the most that is the welcoming and friendly attitude of each and every staff of G t Road Sector 26 Chandigarh. Manager he is extremely super in servicing and friendly nature and the staff was also so good and humbleFish, Chicken, Prawns, Salsa Potato everything was very well cooked. Tender Tandoori Tangri, sooooo YummyyyDeserts also had all kind of variety from ice cream, brownie,  cake, pastries, gulab jamun and many more.Kulfi counter is always loaded with different varieties of kulfiKindly book your slot earlier and reach on time otherwise waiting time is 30 minutes to 45 minutes on n average.I had an amazing experience thank you so much Team,keep it up‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüòãüòãüòãüòã",2
"Service & staff : service and staff  are really good. I would give 5 star for their service a d staffView & location : the view is good, seating is good.Taste: i would say taste wise this restaurant is average. If you go to pirate of grills the food is much better than this. But yes still not that bad taste. You guys should try it.",2
"It was a wonderful experience all in allFrom starters to live counters , main course to desserts everything tasted just so scrumptiousLoved the serviceWonderful Hospitality!!",2
"Ambience, food, taste, service, everything was ultimate. Highly recommended... Variety of food .... If you're a food lover then you should visit there.",2
Punjab meets a Brazilian steakhouse which meets a Korean BBQ spot. This place is great. Will definitely come again when we‚Äôre back in India.,2
"Food is awesome, hospitality is awesome, service is awesome, even cutlery is perfect five star to them! Loved their butter chicken, aloo meat, mutton kebabs and garlic naan. Even their sweets were lovely special mention for their besan ladoo, pinni and gulab jamun. Finally finished off with paan and different variety of churan. Was also served complimentary soft drink. Price of veg and non veg buffet on Thursday as of today is Rs 852 plus taxes. P.S: Things they need to work upon: non veg starters, quality of fish being used and chicken biryani coz I tasted these items.",2
"A good place to have buffet meal with friends and family. They have an assorted menu and offer many choices. Service is fast and staff is humble. The main sitting area is like a huge hall, very spacious. There are small private space which can be booked for special occasions. Overall a good place to hangout and an alternate to other famous buffet spots of the tricity.",2
Awesome food and ambience. Alot of variety  in tye buffet. Its priced competetively with Barbeque Nation and Pirates of Grill but GT Road offers more variety.Early Bird offer at 12 to 12:30 in the afternoon is good if you want to get some discounts. Non veg would cost arou d 850 rupees at early bird,2
Non veg options are less than barbeque nation or absolute barbeque.... But the taste  is much better,2
"Not upto mark. I am regular visitor of GT Road restaurant at Cannaught Place and have pleasant experience but Chandigarh's GT Road is lacking in variety, quality and main course. Starters were also below average",0
"The hotel serves barbeque veg n non veg buffet n has good ambiance, location n customer's footfall. We had our buffet dinner here and the spread was lavish. The preparation was average and a little spicy. The service which is key to the barbeque based buffet was disappointing n lacks professional training.Parking is available.",1
"Recently visited GT road sector 26 ChandigarhI was really a good experience there ,it has amply seating area ,having very cooperative staffs.it give u feel of royalty nd elegant,I enjoyed food at live counter nd prawns ,fish nd chicken lolipop is highly recommended and yes how can I forgot about desert section damn it was so good nd tasty nd lots of varieties present there.u should definitely visit there atleast for once .thnks me later",2

"The GT Road is situated by the side of road on Madhya Marg Sector 26 before grain market sector 26 chandigarh. Many food restaurant situated here. Yumm food and attractive interior. The vintage car is the main attraction.Should improve the lightings.They offers veg and non veg barbeques, starters, drinks, live counters of many Indian and Chinese cousins, main course and sweets.you need to pay for sector parking space.",2
"When we are opting for lunch with team outside, always Sector 26 comes in mind. Plenty of options are available but this time we selected GT Road.  Nice place for small get together with friends and office colligues. We started with veg starters, they have quite a variety in it some of the things were really new to me like :- Palak patta chaat, kaanji bada and chilly egg. After having amazing starters we moved to our main course which was equally delicious. The best thing I like in GT road was their Gajar halwa which was mind-blowing and was highly recommended to us.Ambience ~ 5/5Service ~ 5/5Value for Money ~ 5/5Also I would highly recommend this place for their amazing service, beautiful Ambience with lots of antiques and delicious food. If you are food lover then this is the place to visit.We selected it over Swagat as we always refer to go there for peaceful environment to have chit chat during our lunch but the light music here was very pleasant. Out team members like it very well.No issue for parking centeraly located. Nice services, nice preparation, nice presentation of dishes.Good keep it Up guys!!",2
"An exclusive Barbeque Buffet Dine-in restaurant reminiscent of British era. Located on Madhya Marg, sector 26 of Chandigarh amidst cluster of the Hotels, restaurants and food-joints. This property is spacious enough and accomodates a large number of clients. Well segmented Entrance, Sitting, Bar, Utilities, Food Buffet, Pudding and Live counters for Chat, Cocktail Veg-Kababs, Dimsums, Maal-pua & Non-veg snacks, large sitting area followed a by sitting enclosure. Utensils used converge with the theme of 18th-19th century habitation.You have continuous history lessons on screens mainly on GT road theme and various food items native of the regions GT road traverses through.Good number of veg, Non-veg snacks are served apart from table top Barbeque. Snacks served are good but mostly salt content is more than usually served in the restaurants. At least 3 chicken snacks tasted same. Tandoori chicken is really good and quite tender. Fish and Prawns are nice.Main course has good variety Chicken Biryani & veg Pullao are good. Having enough snacks there's hardly room left for food, yet one can't resist trying Mutton Nihari and Fish in Kasundi Sauce.There's good spread of Pudding but limited choice of ice creams. Vanilla flavour doesn't appear to be Milk ice cream.Bar has good variety to suit one's taste and choice.Fatigue of the staff becomes visible after about 40 minutes, needs attention of the Management. Since it's not too long this restaurant started functioning, can be taken care of.Overall it's nice, would love to see improvement during next visit.",2
Best place ever visit...  Very very very Happy to visit here.... Staff members was very nice and humble... Best thing i find is the behavior of staff and the kind treatment they give... Staff was very polite and nice... I would like to visit gt road again.. Food was very very very very delicious and quality is also good... Must visit the place. The buffet is worth.,2
"I have been to the GT road twice with my family. It has been a good experience both times. The ambience is really good. And food is 4/5. The service is great. I loved the fish snacks, prawns & veg snacks as well. Desserts were good but could have been better. And main is good too but the choices were limited. Maybe because it just opened after lockdown. Overall the experience was good.",2
We celebrated our son‚Äôs second birthday today and we were around 30 pax. The arrangement was exceptional. Staff was very cooperative. Would like to add special thanks for Mr. Ravi who managed the event very well.,2
The best buffet I've ever visited with number of options and quality food. Service is very fast you will not be able to finish one thing another will come. The dessert was also amazing. The old theme of this buffet restaurant fascinates me. This restaurant is total value for money,2
"Food was good. But nothing is as good as barbecue nation.Ambiance is nice. We had lunch and it was good. They have really good variety.We liked starters, chat, bhala,  bhelpuri and some desserts.  Main course was ok. Especially crispy corn and paneer tikka.Service was nice. Staff members are really humble.I guess they will improve over time...!",2
"It was fine evening and we were searching for some good food and then decided to go for G.T Road.We reserved our table on zomato and quickly got the confirmation.As soon as you enter, their interior js very catchy. We chose to sit near the buffet since we were too lazy.Walls are decorated with old traditional photographs, utensils, and pickle Jar.We chose to have two veg and two non veg buffet.Food was quickly delivered and they Even got the snacks ready which were not on the buffet menu that time Dahi k sholay since one of my friend like that alot.Most liked: Dahi papdi, paneer tikka, tandoori chicken and almost every sweet.Main course was fine too, we were already too full to grab the all items in main course.It‚Äôs a good place for family, get together.We had a good time.Hope the same for you.",2
"The entrance doesn't justify this place.... It's really a portal to old times...Feels like eating in an old and rich Punjabi household...Even bathrooms are according to the theme....It was really cool....I had veg buffet...Food was awesome and really affordable....I usually don't eat out coz of the too much oil and mild food..But food was really like homemade Punjabi food...I loved everything about it...Staff is really helpful, friendly and professional... ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",2
I try their buffet it was awesome food was excellent and their is variety of snacks and the maine thing is their snacks and their sweet dish was amazing they can improve their main Crouse also and the servants was very nice and humble you should visit the Gt road,2
"Finally the much awaited place has opened it's door for the Tricity peeps. A place where you would fall in love with the food .I recently went to this amazing place along with my family and was totally mesmerised by the food quality . If you are bored of repeatedly visiting the same old buffet places in Chandigarh/panchkula/mohali , then you must visit this gorgeous place nested in sector 26, Chandigarh to try the impeccably delicious food . Staff is so warm and welcoming . Services are just too good .The G.T.ROAD is a 2600km long road and in the same manner the place offers you a journey of a 2600km long food journey starting from kabul to chittagong .As soon as you will enter the place you will see a beautiful vintage car at the entrance . Those beautifully done interiors and decor truly justifies the theme of the restaurant and depicts many stories of historical times .Once you seated down the gastronomical journey begins withCHAAT SECTION which includes Raj kachori, bhalla papdi, palak patta chaat . The chaat counter is live .One can watch the entire process of making and get it customised according to the likes and dislikes .IN STARTERS i.e. The shuruvaat section I had :‚Ä¢Crunchy corns‚Ä¢Aloo chane ki tikki ‚Ä¢Chatpata ananas‚Ä¢Teekhi Soya Chaap‚Ä¢khumb Chutney wale‚Ä¢Paneer TikkaFingerlicking good !In main course they have a lot of options for both vegetarians and non vegetarians .My favourite from the vegetarian section were :‚Ä¢Dal Makhani‚Ä¢kadhai Paneer‚Ä¢Achaari Beingan‚Ä¢Aloo Methi‚Ä¢Attock Chana Rijai‚Ä¢Missi Roti‚Ä¢laccha paratha‚Ä¢Butter NaanIf you are someone who loves mughlai cuisine you will surely love buffet at G.T.ROAD .Each & every dish was standing out in terms of flavours and taste . I just love it .Last but not the least the best part of buffet "" DESSERTS "" .They serve almost 16 types of Indian desserts . If you are a dessert lover you must save some space for all of these.My favourites dessert were :‚Ä¢Balushahi‚Ä¢Gulabjamun‚Ä¢Gur Paan wali icecream ‚Ä¢moong dal halwa‚Ä¢sheer khurma‚Ä¢Gulkand k pedeIn drinks I tried Buntas :Do not miss these .So refreshing .My favourite was lychee bunta.All in all G.T.ROAD is soacious place with standard buffet .Overall this outlet is quite foremost in terms of satisfying hospitality and the finest delicacies. STAFF was humble , smiling and prompt .Served promptly assisted us throughout the food experience.I highly recommend you all to visit this place .I am sure you will love it too just the way I do.",2
"Food was very good. atmosphere is really fantastic, Staff is very polite and humble , Price is also very reasonable if you decided to have a buffet. Go and chill",2
It was a lovely experience at GT Road. The Service was really good and the taste was out of the world i must say. The Tagri was the best of all and for ambience 100/100. Its Pocket Friendly Too.,2
"The place came across as a comfortable space, full of light. We were welcomed with a refreshing Raj kachori or chaat papri. The grilled snacks were delicious too. But the bel Puri was soggy and insipid. Main course was just luke-warm & they apologised for it. We loved the deserts- Indian deserts mainly. The miniature ‚ÄòPinni‚Äô and Ghiya barfi are worth trying. Service was good. My rating 3 1/2 ‚≠êÔ∏è",2
"New place in the city for lunch and dinner.That's amazing . The ambience was truly killing. Talking about food , well food was fantastic everything was fresh and tasty as it's available in buffet so , they have alot variety in starters they have more than 4 varieties in chat coming to main course they have both nonveg and veg as the name indicate gt road so they have all the cuisines coming the way of gt road !! Must try :) deserts was awesomeüòäüòäüëå",2
"Great service,  ambience, food variety including a plethora of options in desserts.
Practising good covid control practices. Its a good place to fill urself up.. They do serve alcohol but with limited menu of cocktails.",2
Extraordinary buffet experience.... Loads of variety in food ... one of the best barbecue buffets I have ever had ... great hospitality and mouth watering food ... Antique look of the restaurant adds on to the taste of the food,2
"Despite my disappointment with the tasteless and unappetizing food at GT Road Chandigarh, the redeeming factor was the commendable service. I took the liberty to share my concerns with the executive chef and the assistant restaurant manager, hoping for improvement in the future.",0
"Best quality food, very good quality  starters and main course and  refreshments after food i.e paan kane juices icecreams were simply yummdaar :)Also must say what an ambience. Must visit if you are looking for alternative bbq",2
"A great place for a buffet meal. Nice decor and lighting. Seating is comfortable. Advise booking your table. Staff is helpful, courteous and soft spoken. Snacks are good and unlimited. Main course is tasty. Dishes represent various places along the GT road. Parking is an issue",2
"The quality and variety of food is very poor. Sorry, I shall never recommend it to anyone.",0
"A perfect spot for family to spend and have family time with great food and wonderful ambience around , it is a unique place to expirence it for the first time and has a lot for dishes from veg to non-veg from starters to desert , everything is delicious.",2
"Though the ambience is awesome, however the first thing you would notice is the heavy utencils. The food was Ok and for most part it was good, however the Pan Icecream had too strong flavours. Rest a great family place.",2
"Visited yesterday for brunch. Service was good , non veg snacks were good , main course was like 8/10 , and dessert was average. Apart from this , Aura was wonderful and if you have a group of 5+ people,  you could come here",2
"My overall experience here is good and the food is awesome.I love their Paneer Tikka, Crispy Corns and Salsa Potatoes in Starters.Main Course is average, but the breads are so smooth. And in sweets try everything as all these are best and most love thing is Jalebi with Rabri üòãüòãüíØ 4/5 to StartersüíØ 3/5 to Main CourseüíØ 5/5 to Sweet DishJust their service is slow.",2
"The quality of food has dropped drastically.The staff is untrained, I had to request individually for each snack. Even the pizza slice was served to me after 30 minutes of continuous requests, that too cold.Worst experience at GT Road in so many years.",0
"I had lunch here with my friend.... The buffet costed us around 690 ... The starters were good and the main course was good .... The thing that I didn't like was that the buffet did not had a complimentary drink and the dessert had all the Indian sweets .... Eg ladu , jalebi etc. No brownie üòî",2
"BBQ was good, we had veg Buffet only which was good with given options and taste wise appealing. However the soya chap was pathetic. Dessert menu was elaborate and good to taste, we hated the jelly cubes.. Halwa , chocolate ball and cake were good, they have plain ice cream of various flavours in buffet too. Don't fall for the superfast BBQ service, they do that to fill you with starters and save on main course..Washrooms are okay (just need some ventilation) Enjoy and savour",1
I used to bring along my friends and family as one of their most loyal customers because of the experience. Now things have changed. You might get the food which you might get elsewhere but experience was different,0
Very good experience. Well behaved staff. All the food items veg and non veg are yum. Must have experience if you are visiting Chandigarh ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,2
Food was good. Great variety specially in desserts. But the complimentary drink was not good. Atmosphere was not as expected may be due to less space as compared to seating.,2
"Nice place to hangout with friends, people who drink can come with group , people who loves buffet can come here. Ambience is good and lovely nice environment",2
Variety of Veg Non-Veg delicious food served. Service is fast. The staff is soft-spoken. The ambiance is eye catching.  Lots of variety of Sweet Dish available along with fruits. Reasonably priced.,2
Very delicious and unique dishes. Service is good.,2
"Not worth it, really bad tasting food versus the price they charge. Ambience was too chaotic for you to enjoy your food. Buffet dinner area was really cramped. Won't recommend this to anyone... Better to head for a dhaba",0
It is a massive menu and you should really have a huge appetite to consume all. Most of the things are exceptionally tasty. Not 5 star as the counters are not at one place and you are bound to miss out on somethings,2
"Good food, having classical ambiance. Good place for family. I have ordered veg buffet. The plates was of tamba. Service was too slow. Good place for family.",2
Good place for buffet with family. They serve one first come first serve basis. Ambience is great. Love the environment. Tasty food and options can veg or non veg. Staff is humble and they ask for tastes and improvement which is very necessary.,2
Never disappoints ... Better than BBQN in my books... Un matched service and a diverse menu... What else do you want? Lol,2
The G T Road Restaurant Chandigarh : Great ambiance and good food. Service was quick and they are more than happy to go out of the way to make your experience better. Easily visible from the main road. Wheelchair accessible parking and entrance.,2
"G.T Road is a good place for one time dining experience. It's interiors are set in the old retro vibe of Punjab. It's a buffet restaurant which offers starters, main course, desserts and s complementary drink. The food is average. I liked the sweets section the most. Paan ice cream is a must. It's good for a one time experience.It's rates are equivalent to barbeque nation and pirates of grill but it's not really up to the mark.Rating - 3/5",1
"Restaurant claims to serve food along with GT ROAD but not lacks to do so.. for if we talk about vegetarians, choices are few.. also options in barbeque food for veg. is only 3..  stars are for their momos, panpatta chat and pan icecream..rest all are average..",1
"Buffet is good, starting from the snacks to main course and dessert. There are more than 100 varieties of food. Everything seems fresh.",2
Disappointed with the service of this Restaurant's. Aroma was Good but professionalism in Waiters were absence. They should concentrate on their Staff's Discipline then Food afterwards. Only snack I likes Was Crispy corn and Pineapple that's it. Only center of attraction was that Prototype Vintage Jeep. That's It.,1
Food is good and Ambience is amazing.It was a little pricey but staff is very helpful and cooperative.Only go there if u have a good appetite and u are a foody. People who have a sweety tooth should also go there for visit.Please try jalebi rabri it is fantastic.,2
"""Unchi Dukaan feeka pakwaan""
went there for buffet lunch with family, starters were ok, much verity in starter & in sweets. but main course was not upto mark, not tasty & more salty.. ice cream had only 2 flavours. feels bit costly compared other buffets.",1
"The ambiance is fabulous.the staff is also very well mannered.the Barbeque and starters can get better, but the desserts were good‚Ä¶..neither too sweet nor too bland",2
"Though the menu is very similar to Pirates of grill, nonetheless a good place to eat. Menu was elaborate and food delicious. Different counters within the restaurant provide u with fresh hot delicacies on the go. Enjoyable experience overal",2
"I had to dinner  at very delicious.  At restaurant is very sumptuous  overall it was very    exelelinte.. chicken burrah,  pineapple, mutton  gulife shike is very delicious  thanks  chef's Manoj is very bell",2

"This cozy restaurant has left the best impressions! Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation, wide snacks  list and wonderful dessert. I recommend to everyone! I would like to come back here again and again.a family restaurant for buffets.i had dinner with my family whole experience was goodsnacks - 4/5main course - 3/5service - 3/5ambience - 4/5",2
Starters are really nice but the main course is weak... Ambience is good and service is also top notch... They need to pay attention to the main course which can help the place to grow more.,2
Food  quality was superb! Bit crowded! Waiting hour is almost half n hour.,2
Good ambience. Good food especially starters and desserts. Very good service.,2
"Nice experience in a pandemic time, staff maintain all safety and pericousions of covid yummy food nice services coprative, helping staff members and Love pan after food after food they serve meetha pan according to your teast its really amazing experience for me",2

"The Aircon not working  and it was too hot
Service and food quality was nowhere near Punjab standard. Most of the items lacked taste. Even the barbeque items did not have proper marination.",0
Poor quality food with a generic menu. Not a great value for money at all. The restaurant was smelling and so were the washrooms. Choice of music for a sit-down restaurant was atrocious.,0
"Very lively place, spacious tables, ample parking outside, delicious food, menu on the lines of its ancestors but tastefully presented. Courteous staff.",2
I have been there two times in the last 15 days just because of the quality of food but the price is a bit high.,2
Amazing experience and amazing food. Its an experience. They also have bbq on the table with everything you want. They have great Buffet and desserts.,2
The restaurant has large capacity and great variety of food items. It is a good alternative to Barbeque Nation,2
Best experience ever and all the dishes as well interior very nice and precious. All the staff was very cooperative and easy to understandable.... I love this restaurant and I suggest to others please go and experience once in your life.....!!,2
"The G.T. Road, restaurant itself is a museum which showcases a glimpse of our heritage.With vintage interiors and pleasant ambiance, takes you to an exquisite food journey inspired from the 2600 km course of the Grand Trunk road.Located in Sector 26 Chandigarh, have a huge hall as main sitting area, also havesmall private space which can be booked for special occasions. Clean washrooms, has sufficient paid parking space,They have an assorted menu and offer many choices. It focuses on providing a royal buffet experience at an affordable rates. There is open buffet with snack served on table. Food variety & quality is excellent. Staff is very courteous.During our recent visit to Chandigarh, we were invited here for dinner by our family friend @Ruby Simarjit and her lovely family. Had a wonderful experience and beautiful memories, which will always remain in my heart.Overall a good place to hangout and an alternate to other famous buffet spots of the plant city, Chandigarh.",2
"This is our second consecutive years we celebrated our bdy here awesome service,grt aroma. Love it being here... hopefully will come next year.....see yaay",2
"Excellent fud , d cost fr buffet was 525 including taxes but fud was completely worth it. Only veg menu available.",2
"Atmosphere was good i like it very much, but non veg options were more than veg, crispy corn i like more than any veg item, i think it depends on your preferences what you like or not, i did not enjoy that much compared to barbecue nation. i like barbecue nation & there stuff, even pineapple starters in GT Road were not as tasty as barbecue nations's pineapple starters. its my choice may be you like depends upon you n your taste buds.thanks for reading and enjoy your day....anything i mis please let me know....Vegetarian options: vegetarian options were less than non veg optionsParking: when i visit parking lot was full so we find some difficulties in find parking lot for car",2
"Extremely poor buffet, snacks are ok ok only. Dinner Food is pathetic along with deserts. In deserts they have very small little sample size dishes which are extremely useless and worthless to even try and taste. Only thing we liked was Paan Icecream and Gulkand Kulfi. So if you're looking out for a place for family buffet, GT Road is definitely NOT the place for you. Better have Alacarte at some nice place instead paying so high here.",0
A nice place for your small to medium get together. Courteous staff. Excellent facilities. Request management not to miss chance to educate visitors follow hygienic practices by avoid mixing spoons while dish selection in buffet. Relished the food & liked the concept.,2
"The best part of this place is the variety that they offer in both veg and nonveg buffet at this price range. (See the menu below)Food taste is upto the mark. Their service is very quick.Its a place where you would love to visit more often.Their rates are (as on 18 July 2021)Mon & Tuesday lunchVeg@695N.veg@695Wed,Thursday and Friday lunchVeg@695N.veg@775Sat  lunchVeg@775N.veg@875Sunday lunchNeg @795N.veg@895Dinner mon and TuesdayVeg@785N.veg@795Wed,dinnerVeg@845N.veg@945Dinner ThursdayVeg@775N.veg@875Dinner fridayVeg@845N.veg@945Sat and sunday dinnerVeg@895N.veg@995All prices are with taxesI got the rates in message from them otherwise wouldn't have done this much Kasht..... ;-)",2
Wonderful place to be visited with your friends and family for good food experiences in huge variety large menu options unlimited food & delicious desserts,2
"Good food. Great ambience. Amazing service.
Been here couple of times now.",2
"This is old Bollywood theme bar and a little bit Dhaba. You will find many pictures of Dharmendra and also the antique motorcycle he used in a movie. Coming to the food they focus more on western items which contradicts the overall theme. To my surprise they did not have tea available, chai is the most basic drink in India which they didn‚Äôt have. The food was just okay, nothing special about it. The only thing i liked was the ambience of the place",1
Went out with family. We are in total 6 people.  Sitting was good. There were plently of eating options from snacks to soups to main course. Everything is cooked fresh. Whatever we ordered was fresh. Yes it did took some time but was worth.As Everything was cooked fresh so it did took some time for food to come. Next was quantity. Trust me their quantity is amazing. One veg platter sizzler was enough for 6 people.Price was also quite reasonable. Would definitely come return and recommend,2
"It was an Okay Okay Experience, Though Starters were Good in Quantity as well as Taste but Talking About Main Course It was Tasty but Quantity was Quite Small & price is on Higher Side as compared to other Reputed Restaurants.",2
"Good food. Nice vibrant place with old Dharmendra nostalgic movie memoirs.Biggest issue was service in an almost empty restaurant at around 2205 hours. Had to look for person to take order and after some struggle, guy in sky blue shirt came to table but his attitude and service was like why the heck did you come here, now I will have to work.He was so irritating,  had kept around 10 glasses piled up on my table and was trying to just dump all on the table to make me frustrated and leave.Good things, food was very nice. Ambience was good.",1
"WORST CHICKEN BIRYANI, roadside 100-200 biryani tastes much better than theres. It only smells good but zero taste and pieces are rubber like. Rest other food is average but quite expensive compared to taste.",0
"It's nice place to have quality food with your loved ones. If you are going with big family then, in my suggestion call before you leave, as this resturant is busy one.The prices are a bit high but it's totally worth it....So enjoy your meal at Garam Dharam!!!",2
Food was okay but pricey as regards to its quality. Quantity of curry was  very less yet the price was too much. Ambience was okay but shabby. Restroom was small and had limited facilities.,1
"This bar has an old Bollywood theme with a touch of Dhaba vibe. You'll spot numerous pictures of Dharmendra and even the antique motorcycle from one of his movies. However, despite the theme, they mainly offer Western cuisine, which doesn't quite match the overall ambiance. Surprisingly, they didn't have tea available, which is a staple drink in India. The food was average, nothing extraordinary. The only aspect I enjoyed was the ambiance of the place.",2
"We were travelling and we had a halt at  Chandigarh, we stopped by this place hearing its a good one that had a bar.But, we were extremely disappointed after visiting.Horrible sound tracks which were a big turn off.The food was not as good as the price they charge.And extremely bad service.The staff were not interested in serving at all.Would never suggest anybody to go there.Its better to eat at a road-side dhaba.",0
There was a hair in my soup and I returned it when i saw it. Despite this fact they charged me for it in bill saying we asked you to get it replaced and you denied it so its not our problem. Staff was very rude and argumentative.,0
Service takes too long but the food is worth it. Paneer dishes in general have too much salt.,2
"Nice dining restaurent provide both veg and non veg cuisine. Also, you can get drinks as well. Little bit costly compared to some other options available in the locality.",1
"1. Staff without dress giving pathetic ambience2. Specially instructed to keep the food less spicy ....when food came, it was super spicy ...asked for the chef ....Manager came and asked like GAbbar Singh "" ki ho gaya Sirrrrrrr"" and Chef came and instead of going towards resolution, he  started arguing that "" jo mirch khate hai unke liye to bohot badiya hai"". Finally bought another dish which we dint liked.Our guests were from abroad, and it was pathetic experience.""""Shame Shame on the entire team Dharam Garam. """"Please improve.",0
"Twice have I visited this restaurant and never did they disappointed me. .1. COVID guidelines were partially followed. The staff was wearing masks but no distance was kept between the tables. It was houseful with people in queue outside to get assess.2. The food quality and quantity was amazing. Very well prepared and nicely served!! The drinks are refreshing. One must try their signature mock tails. They are different and worth it.3.On the other hand, some of the items in the menu were overpriced. For instance, ‚ÄúAnda Bhurji ‚Äú was worth Rs. 395. Matlab seriously ?????!!! aisa kya dalte ho khas.??!!!! There are some more items which does not need to be overpriced as per its constituents. Please work on it.4. The staff is well behaved; quite aware of their menu. The frontline manager ( regulates the influx and outflux of customers) was very Cooperative & amicable and facilitated us with quick seats even in the rush hours.5. The ambiance is good. You will see Dharminder every where in the restaurant. The music was thankfully modern. The seating arrangement is comfy.Overall, it was a wonderful evening spent. You guys need to work on some points, otherwise everything is superb.",2
Garam Dharam Family Restaurant Chandigarh : Visited today there with family. The place needs advance booking if you are going in weekend's.the place is in great demand.The liquor service is very prompt. Dining at this place gives a nice feeling. Food is ok. Very centrally located easily accessible in Tricity. Wheelchair accessible parking and entrance.,2
This restaurant is dedicated to yesteryear Superstar Dharmendra ji and every detailing of interior is dedicated to him only. The ambience is great. It‚Äôs famous of North Indian cuisine but few Chinese options are also available. They have in house bar as well. I was little disappointed with the food as it was little bland in taste. The gulab jamun served were stale.,1
"Excellent food. Unique decor. Unobtrusive and good service. Amazing prices.That about sums it up.Try the chicken wings btw. I don‚Äôt know if Dharmendra eats chicken wings but I imagine if he did, it would be these kind.",2
"Fine dining dhaba experience.
Good food and ambience dedicated to the owner and bollywood legend Dharmendra.
Good variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.",2
Taste of food was not that good. Even the price is a bit high. Staff were good and the theme is also nice. Specially dal makhani was not upto the mark.,1
We took our dinner here. Interior was like old Bollywood movies. So many photoframes tractor bike with support were feeling with amazed. The behaviour of the personnel was also very supportive. Quality of food was also good but chances of improvement were there. Overall it was a nice experience to visit there with mixture of bollywood and desi styles of utensils.,2
"If you are going there with your partner, please avoid as this restaurant ignores people who go in a pair as staff thinks order won‚Äôt be much from them. Very poor service as two staff members were very rude. They don‚Äôt know how to treat the customers. We have been waiting for our attendant to serve water but he kept ignoring us. Than we asked other attendant to serve is water(who was polite). Than we complained to manager and things got sorted there. But again when he served food he put the bread bowl as if he is beating it on table.. that was sooo rude.I would not recommend you to go there with your partner if you don‚Äôt want to feel insulted and humiliated.",0
The food and ambience is top notch. The service is efficient and the staff is friendly too. Food has the authentic north indian touch. Has variety of food and beverages in the menu. Highly recommended restaurant to try ! .,2
"A pleasant place with very colourful theme and the touch of the light background music is really good. Taste of the food with the great service is excellent. I would like to focus on their balwan family naan that was something new and huge it was like 1/4th pc sufficient for a single person. On an avg everythng was really good that includes ambience, taste, service, etc. Makes the visit worth.....",2
"Lovely place to go to. Has outside as well as inside sitting area which is quite spacious but I'd recommend reservations on the weekends.They have made so many picture taking cute spots/walls/props so as to make you feel in the Dharamendra era.Staff is courteous and polite.The food is good and light. They have varieties of drinks as well. I won't recommend the mocktails (chulbuli, chameli etc) though. They were too basic for my taste buds.",2
"Had a very comfortable and enjoyable dinning experience. Good ambience with good tasting food. Went there for family lunch, they have variety of options. Menu has lots of choices and service was friendly. Overall a great experience.",2
The food was very goodAnd the ambiance was niceThe price was okay.Used dineout for 25% off on the total bill.All alcohol were available which were shown on the menu that's was a big plus.The food wasn't too spicy.And also the service is fastAnd good.Do visit if you want to have good food.P.S: Use Dineout.,2
"Naam bade darshan chhote... They have two seatings... one in front and one at the back... Front one is has good ambiance but the back one is average. The decor is that of total dhaba look. The menu cards were torn. Food items are expensive with very little in quantity. On top of it the taste is very very bland. Went in a group and ordered many dishes in the starters and main course but not even one dish was impressive. Kurkuri bhindi was shredded, had just chat masala flavor with lots of oil taste. Rest of ALL the food items were TOOOO bland and tasteless. Definitely not going again.",0
"Tasty food üëåüèº but prices are higher ...nice ambience of this place ..on the weekend they live singing üé§ ...only old 90‚Äôs songs are played here ..must go , good for family parties or friends group",2
"Good place for a nice north indian meal, snacks and drinks. Place is huge... themed on Dharmendra's movies... good ambience... if you prefer brighter lights the front part(separate) is for you and if you prefer not too bright, then the rear side is for you... i think those who like alcoholic beverages will like the rear area more...",2
The garlic nan and their special and danduri masala paneer sbji was the best upar se last me hot hot gulabjamun to sone pe suhaga .....but only thing I missed unki kheer jo ki almost kar baar available nhi hoti ...overall a mast khana and decoration....On plus side plz try the paan which is just outside their restaurant it will make whole dinner best,2
Very beautiful interior.Drinks were awesom.Rate and quality of food was upto the mark.Loved the ambiance and service.Truly dedicated to Dharam Paaji,2
"A place that I long wanted to go but just didn't get the chance.There is the old world charm of Dharamendra with a lot of his pics decorating the interior of the place.There is also a look alike of the Sholay bike kept here to give a more authentic feel.Decor aside the food is simple punjabi food, taste is good. The service did take 25-30 mins for an order size to serve 8 people.",2
Their theme is totally traditional. They serve you food in copper utensils and even you can get your tea or coffee in a glass.,2
"Lively and lovely place for a delicious North Indian food! They offer alcohol as well along the food, so it‚Äôs a perfect outing for a friends getaway and a family outing.",2
"Okay, so this is q place which takes you back to the 80'S in the era of our beloved Mr. Dharam Sing Deol( whom we all popularly know as Dharmendra).So if we talk about the venue or as said the place, it is built upon the base of movies of the star, and depicting an awesome kind of short trailer of all his films, music at this place is all of his movies songs and so are the interiors.Now, coming to the food, there is no doubt that food over here is just awesome, personally being a fan of paranthas, they have awesome and a variety of lacha paranthas and dishes for vegetarians like paneer, dal, chaap and many more are really good and delicious.The ambience of the place is also very nice and its a great place to spend time with family.Overall, must go place for a punjabi foodie !",2
"The food was very tasty which I didn'texpect though. Their dal fry and PyaareMohan Mast Item is a must-have.And, above all their ARM Vikas hostedus so generously; a gem of a person- extra marks for him.Just a perfect go-to place for family sitting.",2
This is located in sector 26 this dhaba in made on the concept of ‚ÄùSholay‚Äù Bollywood movie this is best place if you want to enjoy the vintage space north indian is the main speciality of this dabha this is a peaceful place best for the couple and family,2
One of the Best Dal Makahni i have ever had .... food was amazing ... we orderd Dal ... Panner Kadia ... paneer was very soft and tastly ...,2
Went here to celebrate my nephew's birthday. Enjoyed good food with hit songs of actor Dharmendra's movies playing in the background. The food was served in rustic Indian style. The place is lively but more popular with the older generation who can easily relate to Dharmendra's films.,2
"One of the finest dining place in Chandigarh. A well decorated ambiance with influence of Bollywood. Authentic Punjabi food served with love. Veg Nonveg both options available. A very cordial staff for service. A must try if you love Punjabi food. Their Jaljeera khumba is a must try. Food quality, tase and vairety is great.",2
"A decent Punjabi restaurant located in sec 26. The place is endorsed by Dharmendra the yesteryears superstar. The vibe and ambience is like any other Punjabi themed restaurant but with a Bollywood mixture mainly related films done by Dharmendra. There is a Enfield bullet at the back of restaurant where you can take a picture of yourself.The food is good and so are the mocktails. We ordered paneer butter masala, Mutter makhana, daal makhani and lachcha paranthas. They all tasted good. All the mocktails we tried were decent except the Coco mint. It is cucumber and mint flavoured drink which may not suit everyone's taste.",2
"The quality of food is super bad. They served half cooked kulcha, soya chaap. The taste is worse.",0
I loved the Dharam sir  vibes there . Overall it's nice experience .....we ordered snacks . It was ok.  parking available. On the main route approach is fine,2
Cheaper than usual restaurants in the area and has a great quality food. But the theme is monotonous.,2
"Dhaba te theka ‚Ä¶A theme based restaurantIf you wanna try authentic Indian cuisine just come here, there have the most authentic taste ‚Ä¶ mouth watering dishesCheck out video review on my Instagram handle @explorer_shubhra",2
Pretty much an expensive place ..... Ambience was a fully retro look .... Loved the vibes .... The food was really good .... I tried tandoori malai soya  .... Which was really good .... In main course I loved the palak corn and kadhai paneer with plain naan ..... It was really tasty .... Loved the flavours .... I tried there pyare Mohan Mocktail which was average,2
Garam Dharam = Veeru da Dhaba !!Lunch was not much satisfactory and all the dishes are above rs. 450 .. the quantity of kadai paneer only for one person...and services are fast...no time wastage or waiting for the order...overall good experience and got the vibes of veeru paaji in the dhaba...,1
Good ambience and a cosy setup. The taste of food was not that great for the price paid. Every dish had a flavour of chilly powder which killed other flavours of the dish.,1
Manager Vikas is too Good and friendly and the staff is also very nice and humble,2
Good place to go n enjoy food with old dharam songs. Parking problem in weekends. Better to go in weekdays. I loved their soft drinks. Hard drinks also available. Prices are genuine but quantity is less. But overall experience is too good. Must go at least once with friends and families :),2
I personally feel that food at garam dharam is a bit expensive but you can visit it as it's interior decorations might facinate you . If you want to taste the aunthintic Punjabi food then this place is for you to be with your family and friends .,1
Extremely poor service. Takes an hour to prepare one dish. Very inconsiderate. They literally wasted our 2 hours and the food wasn't even worth the wait.,0
"When you enter, the feel is a little warm. The staff though projected to be courteous but too slow in service. The lettuce served with grilled pineapple was not cleaned properly and had sand /dirt, there was no regard of the complaint, and no decency to offer replacement or a feeling of being sorry. The overall enjoyment factor of being in a place with official seniors became embarrassing due the bad quality of food.",0
Food was good but not the drinks I ordered He man G.D Cola Banta(which was supposed to have white rum and coke in it) but it tasted like Old Monk + Cola.But Food was finger Licking Good so it steered my mood.Vegetarian options: Kurkuri bhindi a must try.,2
"Loved the restaurant and the food. Colorful & vibrant ambiance along with Dharam Paaji's AVs lifts your mood. Found menu items bit overpriced, but for such ambiance & food, I din't mind.This place has lots of photo booths or selfie points. So come prepared. Had a good time altogether with family.P.s.: CAR Parking is a issue here. Normally  its tough to get parking space in this block.",2
The food is good. Ambience is great but service is quite slow. Overall its good restaurent for family and friends.,2
"Very poor seat allotment procedure. Instead of proper allotment by the manager, seats are open for ""whoever grabs it"", which doesn't suit such a high stature restaurant.But no doubt the food was awesome.",0
"Amazing place, loved the ambience.
Service was pretty good too and quick.
Perfect place to chill out with friends",2
Nice ambience. I ordered butter chicken and the taste was good. One of the best family restaurants in Chandigarh.,2
"Garam Dharam isnt worthy at all be it the food , its quantity or the high rated prices.... taste of food was ok types, qty was really less as according to the prices listed... waiting time for getting a sitting was too long, though ambience is good but what could just the ambience do when the food is not that very tasty and prices are sky rocketing..... would never go there again amd never refer it to anyone for future....",0
Amazing hospitality and delicious preparation. DHARAM ji ki presence in the ambience and super taste of punjab in the food.Lot of space for parking is there and the restaurant has good ambience and great taste.,2
"We went on weekdays and had a great food there.
Dahi ke kabab was awesome and also yellow dal with lachcha partha.",2
"Good ambience, walls painted with dharam paaji's photos.... average food with limited variety.... every thing is overpriced....",1
Food is good but quantity is low as per price. service is very bad,2
Decent place. You can see actor Dharmendra pics and some old stuff all around the restaurant. Feels bit expensive. Overall good experience.,2
It's nice place to have quality food with your loved ones.,2
"Very disappointed with the service and the food.We ordered butter chicken (dharam garam special) with naans, butter chicken was below average in taste and there was nothing sorcial on the other hand naans were  rubber tyres.Waste of time, money and most important it is wastage and insult of food.",0
Very very high quality of food and very pleasant view even inside,2
"Nyc place..bollywood Dharamendra themed. Good decor. Excellent service. I had moong dal halwa in desert, very delicious.one should also try tandoori soya chaap Dharam-garam special, its good üëå",2
"Nothing on the menu is really available.
The person taking orders was rude and unattentive. Wouldn‚Äôt go again",0
Retro theme inspired by bollywood of late 20th centure. Above average food taste. Bar is there. No brewery.,2
Good Food.  Lots of pictures and dialogues from the actor Dharmendra's movies.  Enjoyed the dinner.  The family Naan was big and well made.  Good experience.  Will visit again.,2
"The worst possible food you can get in Chandigarh, I ordered through Swiggy and the food was so bad I had to through everything.
They have such bad service that they aren't even taking up responsibility for their bad service.",0
Good food but lot of dishes were not available,2
Different place with movies theme .. movies of Dharam paajji... good for family.. And menu has mostly punjabi items..,2
"Awsum food and taste‚Ä¶Good Qty, Nice staff",2
"Well,this was my first visit and i am really disappointed.The taste of daal and drinks was not good.The salt was also high in the food.The price they charge was more then high.I dont think these type of food items deserve so much high price.To sum up,i am really disappointed.Management should think about the taste and price of the food items.",0
"Boneless Butter Chicken is mouth watering, topped with Kasoori Methi. Each piece of chicken is very fresh & tender. When had with Butter Tandoori Roti is yummy for your hungry tummy.Super ambience. Desi decor. Welcoming staff. A Dharam movie & song always running.",2
"Garam Dharam is a restaurant that pays tribute to the legendary Bollywood actor Dharmendra. As a fan of his movies, stepping into this restaurant felt like entering a time capsule of his iconic filmography. The interior decor is truly unique, adorned with posters and memorabilia from Dharmendra's most celebrated movies. The ambiance immediately transports you back to the golden era of Indian cinema.One aspect that stood out to me was the helpfulness of the staff. They were knowledgeable about both the menu and the theme of the restaurant, offering recommendations with a warm smile. Their enthusiasm added to the overall experience and made me feel welcomed.Now, let's talk about the food. Garam Dharam serves up a delightful array of dishes that tantalize the taste buds. The menu showcases a wide range of traditional Indian cuisine, featuring both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Every dish I sampled was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. However, it's worth noting that some of the dishes were on the oilier side, which could be a concern for health-conscious individuals.The restaurant also offers a variety of beverages, including mocktails and cocktails inspired by Dharmendra's movies. These drinks add an extra touch of nostalgia to the dining experience.Despite the slight issue with oiliness, I highly recommend Garam Dharam to all Dharmendra fans and anyone looking for a unique dining experience. The ambiance, staff, and delicious food make it a memorable destination for Bollywood enthusiasts and food lovers alike. So, step into the world of Dharmendra and indulge in a sumptuous meal that will leave you satisfied and nostalgic for more.",2
"Overall food is good except paneer tikka have pebbles, decor is so so being light supply through yellow bulbs only, pretty old and uncomfortable",2
"Overrated...not that tasty
Ambience is great with retro Hindi songs",1
Food is good but the rates are exceptionally high which pinches a lot.,2
Bilkul bekar service hai garam dharam restaurant ki as a customer jnha pr Pani bhi nahi serve nhi krte thank u garam dharam ji restaurant,0
Garam dharam is in sec 26 Chandigarh. It‚Äôs a nice restaurant. Specialised in Indian cuisines. The food is good. And the ambiance is also amazing. I went here in 2019. It‚Äôs new place & is getting better everyday. It has several chains all over india. Nice place to go for dinner with family or friends.,2
It was a good experience there. I found it slightly on the costlier side. Otherwise food and drink are tasty.,2
"Neither garish nor staid. Earthy and robust eatery with tariffs of starred joint. There are three distinct sections...front to back. The main dining room  then a  hall with stalls (the Motor cycle of Sholey  fame displayed) and finally the bar  section. Food served in all sections. Having said that, place for easy dining without  pretentions. Small paper napkins, indifferent loo, doesn't add shine to the name of Dharam. Food and snacks are okay,  not oily but the helpings are small compared to the costs. Draught beer is easy on the palate. Hard drinks also served. Staff is helpful and not snooty as yet. Ambience is right. One can take selfies and photos to hearts content without raising eyebrows. Recommended for family outing.",1
"A good authentic Dhaba, with a neat, clean and hygienic place. It is not just ambience but the food that brings difference between Restaurant food and Dhaba food, this includes even the selection of menu items. I loved the food specially Baingan bharta, Daal and chach ( namkeen mattha, with just right consistency. A lovely experiance.",2
The food the ambience is really good. Good place for family or friends hangout. N for sure u cn click many pictures there..,2
Ambient is good. Good quality is also appreciable. Their speciality is Dahi Ke Kebab in snack must try that and Paneer Lababdar is also good.,2
Good food with a price. Overall neat and tidy.,2
Food is good but quantity was not... Ambience is good... Overall it's OK... One must try... I found their rumali rotis very soft...,1
Do not order shahi paneer bot ghatia hai 3rd class,0
Amazing restaurant. We had two veg Thalis. Very generous amount of food. Gravies were authentic for each of the dishes and attention to minute details was quite amazing. Amazingly fresh jeera on the slightly salted lassi added amazing dimensions to the drink. My favorite entree was shahi paneer. Try the hari mirch laccha paratha too. Our server Ghanshyam ji took good care of us and was quite accommodating.Decor inside is beautiful. Dharmendra fans will really love the posters and the Jai Veeru motorcycle (a picture on it is a must!).Vegetarian options: Amazing veg options.,2
"Food is very tasty. Situated at sector 26 madhya marg chandigarh. Interior look is retro. looks wonderful. Staff is good. Menu has good options, recommend for both vegetarians and non vegetarians.
Try Family naaan.",2
Lovely place to have good north indian relishes in Chandigarh.. good chain of hotels..,2

Too much costly but food quality is ok ok.. But best place for photography,1
"just amazing experience, the nostalgia hits you so hard. amazing food, amazing staff, amazing decor. really loved the design.",2
Had a horrific experience. I visited the restaurant today with my family. A rat with a trap fell on me while being seated in restaurant. To add to my trauma none of the staff came forward to help. Visit at your own risk‚Ä¶,0

The tandoori arbi was also too good",2
Average hotel. Food is good not great.,2

"Nice Indian food with a bollywood theme.
üòãHappy diningüòã",1
"Visited there for dinner alonwith my family, there food was below average as compared to their prices and they charged around 400/- ( for only 2 pieces of spring rolls which are not good in taste) and quantity of food( sabji in less quantity ) and the behaviour of there staff is not good. I wll not recommend for dining there.Note: U will get better food in sector 15 market Chandigarh",0
Good,2
Awesome staff. The person who accompanied us was nice and polite. The food was great and more than enough for us. Lighting was good. The sitting can be made less tight. I know you might have tremendous inflow of customers but let's make the ones inside feel comfortable.,2
Speciality drinks were very bland and food was mediocre only thing worth mentioning were the Pina colada and mango lassi,2
Went to this restaurant for family get together on lunch. Must complement the outdoor seating arrangement done by the staff. Starters were good and the main course was delicious. Had a wonderful dining experience and would highly recommend it.Ambience 4/5Staff 5/5Food 4/5Drinks 4/5Location 5/5,2
"Great food, wonderful ambience",2
"Atmosphere is very good. Place is nice and we can reserve early alsoFood is average to bad. When we ordered non veg taste is pretty bad even though meat is fresh.In veg food we ordered, again the food taste is average.Mocktails are goodService is pretty slow. For a meal, 2 hour is min required.Once plus about this place is the atmosphere.All types of payment options available.",1
Was looking for good vegetarian options and my friend took us to Swagath. Being a hardcore non vegetariani don‚Äôt really fancy veg food but the food here was delicious and I didn‚Äôt really miss non veg. The ambience is nice and the staff is attentive and courteous. Service was good and it‚Äôs a nice place to visit with family. Their portion size is small though and hence once star less.Everything we ordered was good and I‚Äôve been told the place never disappoints when it comes to taste which I think is true!Overall a good dining experience.,2
"Excellent spot for family dining; undoubtedly, it stands out as one of the finest dining establishments in Chandigarh.Important tip: Secure a reservation, as there is likely to be a waiting time for available seats.Regarding pricing, it's on the higher side, but the experience and flavors offered make it worthwhile.Hygiene standards are impeccable, earning a perfect 10/10.",2
"Love the food, like the ambience and service was on point you don't have to wait long for the food. Lil bit on the expensive side but you should give it a tryVegetarian options: Dal makhni is the best in the menu",2
"It was not a crowded day when I visited. Sitting is comfortable.But the quality and quantity has reduced across the menu. Following are the main course and starters that we had, saw this problem in all of them.(Taste / Quality / Portion Size) rating out of 5Daal Makhni - (5 / 4.5 / 2)Mutton Rogan Jos - ( 5 / 5 / 4)Paneer Lababdar - ( 3 / 3 / 3)Veg Tandoori Platter - ( 5 / 4.5 / 3)Mangalorian Chicken - ( 5 / 5 / 4.5)",2
Best butter chicken ever. Try with the Kerala porota. Dal Makhani is an absolute delight. Mutton burra tastes similar to Karim's from old Delhi. Pair it with a good collection of wine or beer. Service is excusite. I must recommend this place to all of you butter chicken lovers when visiting Chandigarh.,2
"I had a fantastic experience at Swagath Restaurant. The ambiance was inviting, the service was impeccable and the food was exceptional. The presentation was top-notch. I highly recommend Swagath for a delightful dining experience!!",2
"The food is so delicious that I visited this place thrice during my stay at Chandigarh. The staff is very polite and the place has a nice ambience to it. They have happy hours on weekdays and you get to try some good brands at affordable price. The desert, Sizzler Brownie, is mouth-watering. Highly recommend this place.",2
"We did a small family get-together of about 12 people, and everyone absolutely enjoyed. The food was great, atmosphere was amazing, and the staff was exceptional! We reserved our table and location in advance, and the staff understood the requirements and accommodated all our wishes. One of the best food, ambiance, service, and staff in chandigarh for sure!A must try and highly recommended.Wheelchair accessibility: Yes, the place is wheelchair accessible. There is a ramp for easier movement, and they have wheelchairs in restaurant cor use as well",2
"I visited with 7 of my family members on 13th Feb at around 8pm. The food was fine but the price they are charging is too high, 1 of my family member was on fast we ordered fruits for her & the restaurant charged Rs1000 for normal bowl of fruits then we ordered roasted paneer without salt they charged 650 for that. For the person who was on fast I paid Rs1650 for 1 person. It's overpriced the experience was not that great.",0
"Beautiful ambience you can visit here with your family and friends üòä
I found it little bit expensive otherwise this cafe was fantastic we enjoyed a lot here ‚ò∫Ô∏è",2
"We had dinner at this place along with family friends, the food taste is very good. Inside atmosphere and location of the restaurant is also good. The only thing they need to improve is the service.",2

The service is great and no delay.üî∏Food - The food was mouthwatering. We started with few mocktails and then order Chinese food  and the main course. I like the presentation of food and tasteBest part ‚ò∫Ô∏è Brownie ü§©ü§©",2
"After eating at the Panchkula branch, we went to dine in here with high hopes but was disappointed with the food.The chicken bharta was nice, but methi malai mutter and prawns curry was quite mediocre.Murgh Shorba soup was also quite nice.Service was nice though.",1
"The cozy ambiance of the restaurant sets the stage for a delightful dining experience. From the attentive service to the exquisite flavors in each dish, this establishment seamlessly combines culinary expertise with a welcoming atmosphere. The menu showcases a diverse selection, and the presentation of the food is artful. A definite must-try for those seeking a memorable gastronomic adventure.",2
This is from my heart that I say that is it was just amazing food and ambiance. The service was out of mind and they had 2-4 people located just for table. They made sure we had the time our life while eating. The restaurant was decent Size.  I loves the wooden finish.,2
"If you are foodie and a Nonveg lover . Must visit this restaurant. It's totally worth which you gonna spend on food.There is a dish called Chicken Radda. It's a must try dish for Chicken lovers.  There is a staff , his name is Subhash. He recommended us to have this dish.  I would highly recommend this place for North Indian / Mughlai Food . Ambience, service is also very quick.",2
"Location: Elante mall, 3 floor opposite to pirates of grill and side of Sindhi sweets.Prices: ‚Çπ1500 for 2 people for simple veg meal and shake. Minimum price: ‚Çπ399 for 1 veg dish.Non veg meals are little expensive here. Grilled jumbo prawns (3 pieces) cost ‚Çπ1650.Great place for family & friends get together. I am not sure about this location, however, I visited the Elante mall branch, which have extremely delicious food and great ambience. Staff behaviour is too good. They have great quality even with veg items. Quantity is good for 2 people in one serve. Menu is descriptive.Serve alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Non-alcoholic drinks start at ‚Çπ255.",2
"Ordered Dal Makhni, Chicken Curry, some plain and butter Naans. The absolutely impeccable Swagath quality and simple presentation coupled with staggeringly delicious taste. One of the best Indian chicken dishes I've ever tasted, the curry was a bowl of happiness, the Dal was just the perfection I expect from this restaurant. Good chutney, fresh onions, everything was mind boggling. Great job, guys!!100 percent recommended.",2
"I was a great fan of swagath since 2012 until recently that is oct 23..  my opinion has changed  not bcos of one instance but bcos of my last two visits to this place.I am a south indian and love southb I ndian dishes.In oct 23 we visited this place on a weekday. It was crowded..We ordered pomphret fry,( fish fry) , andhra chicken curry and malabar parotta.Pamphret fry...when the waiter was getting it..the whole hall would have got the smell...typical rotten fish smell..I was with family ..four of us.. and when we tasted it was awfull...believe me it was..I tried to maintain my calm.. generally i get too nasty..but did not spk a word..But then came our friend who took the order asking ""how is the food sir""..I coukdnt resist..So i told him politely taht i am a mallu and know the taste of fish very well.So the fish served was pathetic..we had just taken a bite and kept as it is.. he took all back witha an apology.. and also mentiomed that fish does smell like this..Anyway..thanks to him he did not charge me for fish.. appx..2000 ..Next about the malabar parotta. Parotta is suppose to be flaky and soft..But what they served was dipped in oil and heated in tava..it was jot fresh and flaky...Again disappointed.Andhra chicken was nowhere close to andhra..no spl taste to mention..My second visit 09 feb 24...Most recent.Again paritta same...no change.To my surprise we had a chettinad chicken that was in a white gravy.. with pepper...I think...swagath needs to re think whetehr to continue like this or bring in a change..We tried a new dish ..mangalorean chicken starter... pl dont waste your time and money..That okd swagath... was different.. actually last time that oct 23 i had decided not to visit swagath again but i thoight that could be an aberration.. on monday..a weekday..too much of crowd..But no.. it was really a bad expe...now i have taken ...not to visit again and get disappointed...",0
"Like all other Swagath outlets, food here was superb. Space here is ample to accommodate 100-150 persons at a time. Staff is super friendly, courteous and attentive.This place remains crowded during weekends. I visited this place with my family on a weekday. Although it was not over crowded, it was moderately full of people.We ordered soups, starters and main course meal.  Their Tomato soup was tasty and full of bread crumbs. Russian salad was impeccable and deliciously cooked. Dal Makhani was ok (I have had better Dal makhani at other places).  Methi malai matar was also good. Breads were soft and evenly cooked.Parking wasn‚Äôt an issue here. It‚Äôs a paid parking. Overall, the experience was very good. Highly recommended.",2
"We went at this place on karwa chauth night. On that day there were 1.5 hr waiting. But that waiting is worth once we got the entry and ordered the food.The food was really amazing and tasty.We ordered tandoori broccoli in snacks that‚Äôs awesome. I liked it as broccoli is not so common snacks which is easily available in the restaurants.In tha main course, we ordered daal swagat (daal makhni), paneer tikka masala, lachcha paratha, butter naan, tandoori roti.All main course items were tasty. They food was amazing.",2
We had a family party there with 12 of us there & the experience was pretty good. 5 stars for the service & 4 stars for the food & drinks. It could have been 5 stars for the food but we could not order their signature dishes as we were a largely vegetarian party & the run of the mill dishes we ordered deserved 4 stars. Maybe next time I can taste their signature non veg dishes.,2
"""I had an outstanding dining experience at [Swagath Restaurant And Bar]. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality. The ambiance was charming, with tasteful decor and soft lighting. The menu offered a delightful variety of dishes, and the food was exceptional. I particularly loved the [Signature Dish], which was bursting with flavor. The presentation was impeccable.The service was impeccable as well. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and went the extra mile to ensure our comfort. The timing of each course was perfect, allowing us to savor every bite without feeling rushed.To top it off, the dessert was a sweet masterpiece, and the wine selection was impressive. All in all, [Sawagath Restaurant And Bar] provides an unforgettable dining experience that I highly recommend. It's the perfect place for a special occasion or a memorable evening out. I can't wait to return and try more dishes on their menu.""",2
"Went to this restaurant on the recommendation of an office colleague. The ambience is really good. Tried Malabari Paratha, Paneer Lababdar and Chettinad Peper Chicken. Malabari and Chettinad Chicken was just average. Panner lababdar was decent among all. The service is good. Staff are polite. Rates are high.",1
"The food was pretty good , veg kebab wad amazing and mutton kebab was a lot more chewy... service is good as well. best part is their sitting arrangement, the bar is on the other side where people who prefer alcohol with food can sit and enjoy their time under cozy warm lights
...",2
"We visited swagath at their sector 26 outlet. One of the finest fine dine restaurants of the city which is oldest and serves best quality food as well.We ordered long island iced tea, fresh lime soda, for drinks and medium sized prawns, malai chicken tikka and spring rolls for starters.For the main course we ordered peeli daal, chicken malai methi, garlic naan and paneer tikka butter masala. As a side order, we ordered chicken garlic hakka noodles.The presentation, quality of food is simply superb, subtle in flavours and on point, that will suit the taste palette of almost everyone.Prices may seem to be a bit on the higher side but i guess it wont pinch much if you dont frequently visit.The place is ideal for a family outing.Go try and enjoy yourselves.",2
"The best food in town. It's got a nice and quiet vibe to it, and the service is very prompt and efficient. The starters were good, the main course was superb. Really loved the Malabar parantha (it's a must try).Interior is just beyond amazingFood is good, we tried malai chaap,hyderabadi biryani and mango mojito. Value for money . Service is goodA place to visit with your family and you will have a great time !Very nice authentic South Indian food place, I have been to their Noida, Gurugram, Chandigarh Elante location as well. The ambience is bit outdated compared to other places. Food was good and service was alright. Parking outside was easily available.",2
"We went for lunch and ordered tandoori chicken tikka, as suggested by the server. It was served cold initially and totally bland. Upon complaining they just microwaved it . Least expected from a reputed restaurant. We also ordered their special soup for the day and rice papad, which were good. But highly diasapointed with tandoori item and their customer service upon complaining.",0
"I recently dined at and it exceeded my expectations. The ambiance was inviting, the service was impeccable, and the food was simply outstanding. From appetizers to dessert, each dish showcased exquisite flavors and attention to detail.",2
"It was pleasure been at this restaurant and service is always good and attractive each time me and family visited , they have very well services and food , try it if u haven't, you'll never regret it ‚ù§Ô∏è",2
What an amazing place to be at specially for non veg lovers but they do not disappoint veg lovers too  ,2
"Nice, cozy restaurant with perfect service, hygiene, and bonmot. Thank you so much.",2
Ambience is litFood is deliciousThey have great variety and food is adequately spicy.One of the best meals of this yearHighly recommendedPlace does not accept bookings via appsLiquor is also servedHappy customer,2
I do not recommend this place to anyone as they are looting customers. A 40 rupee MRP Diet Coke was charged with Rs. 169. When asked about selling above MRP cost they did not had any answer. Better try other outlets.,0
"Decent place for nice Indian food , good thing is its open till 2 am with bar.",2
Service is very goodFood is deliciousThey have great variety and food is adequately spicy.One of the best meals of this yearHighly recommended,2
"Best place to try some authentic South Indian dishes, though they serves North Indian and Chinese cuisine as well but the Chettinad Chicken, Fish/Prawns and with Malabari Parontha/Apam is a must try.Swagath has a well stocked up bar to enjoy some drinks along with the food.",2
"Well admittedly it was my very first visit to a restaurant after the lockdown has been relaxed after so many months; and as a customer the very first thing is to be assured about the safety and hygenic efforts being put in by the restaurant especially when the industry has by their own admission suffered huge losses in business because of Covid situation.I have had been a regular customer of swagath restaurant and its been, so far, without any issues where our dining experience has been absolutely delightful. However i would like to point out a few things that without the customer being pressed to explain should have been carefully looked after during their service.First, although the staff all were in masks i didn't see anyone donning gloves to serve the meal, I don't really doubt their claim of hygiene but if don't see it, i can't believe it. It's as simple as that! Also how much pain it would be in their effort to offer the option of contact less menu? Because i sure didn't see any! The same menu travels in between different hands in the day and no amount of sanitization can affect this careless gesture that might be responsible for spread of any contagious disease.Second, since I have dines here way too many times I could see the prices inflated and the quantity somehow being less in the main course. The meal though remains delicious and satisfactory however I would like to see more effort being put up to keep the relaxation and reassurance of the customer especially in these trying times.",2
One of the best fine dining experiences in Chandigarh. You can never go wrong with Swagath. I have been visiting here since 2007 and the quality of food has always been amazing.,2
Overall good experience. Food taste and service level were both good. It is quite crowded and packed most of the nights and is good for family dinner outing.,2
"I recently dined and had an exceptional experience. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was cozy. I highly recommend their signature dishes.",2
"The food was good there. Service was fast. By the past 8 pm, the restaurant started getting crowded, and at that time, it seemed a bit congested.  Restroomsüöª were for single person use, which was insufficient while the restaurant was running at its maximum capacity.",2
The food was delicious and tasty. I loved it although the service was also quite good. I Appreciate it. I'll recommend everyone to go and enjoy the food,2
"The service was very attentive, main dishes are shareable sizes. The food was good.",2
"This place is amazing, with great service and even better food.... The attention to detail is amazing, they even split the appam into 4 parts for us (4 people)...I highly recommend the chicken stew and malawari porota",2
I have been going to swagath from a very long time. Really used to like daal gharwali .BUT BUT BUT... Came 2024 they hiked the price of daal  by almost 200 rupees to whopping 600+ (for a daal) and DISGUSTED by the taste  and quality of food. Same was the vase with Paneer butter masala.My new year resolution-Swagath is becoming overtly hyped with very less of taste for the COST of food.Daal from dhaba would have been better.Vegetarian options: Limited quantity of options with NOT WORTH THE MONEY TASTE.,0
Great food .u definitely need to book on advance as this place gets very busy,2
"Clean & hygienic restaurant.. good behaviour n food quality is superb..
Perfect for family & friends....you have to visit and spent your quality time here..",2
"The quality of food is too good

"You can taste foods from Mangalorean cuisine (South canara). I tried chicken sukka, surmai (Anjal) rava fry and neer dosa. These were lip smacking. Apart from that, the ambience is amazing with the best hospitality.Parking: Paid parking üòÜ",2
This is the best resto-bar in the neighbourhood.Reasonably priced.Friendly staff.Quick service.Variety of delicacies.It's a must visit place if you're in the neighbourhood.,2
"I visited on a packed weekend make sure you have a reservation, gaps between the other tables is very less you will hear constant random people voices. It feels like they are sitting with you. Rest the preparation was fine, they can improve as the tomato soup was below average and chapatis were cold but the mocktails were good. Recommended mocktail - passion of Christ and in the dessert sizzler brownie is wow!!",2
It is great fine dining restaurant in the city for North Indian as well as authentic South Indian and Chinese cuisine. I think one of the best one I love that butter chicken ü§§ that was so yummy üòã.......,2
"The food is so delicious. The staff is very polite and the place has a nice ambience to it. The desert, Sizzler Brownie, is mouth-watering. Highly recommend this place.",2
"We went to lunch and we came across a Cockroach    on our table and asked the waiter to see that. I didn't say anything at that time but when I asked them to call the Manager, Mr Suresh,  came and talked so rubbish about what he could do,  it's normal as these are found in everyone's home.  I felt like I was sitting in some 3rd class Dhaba who doesn't bother about the reputation.  So sad to see this kind of dealing and not recommended for food at all.Thank you.",0

"Elante swagath is better than this outlet and the staff too. In elante we ordered Raan e meherbaan that was amazing was a starter which was served with separate gravy, we went to swagat again just for this dish but the taste was not that good, even the staff denied to serve separate gravy, highly disappointed..I will suggest to go elante as the service, staff and food is much better..",0
The place was very clean and neat they treated ous very gentle foods also nice and tasty viset with family,2
"Wonderful Restaurant, food served very tasty and healthy, quick service last but not least behaviour of all staffs are excellent",2
"The restaurant serves delicious food with a wide variety of options that cater to different tastes, making it a food lover's paradise. However, the service can be a bit slow at times, which might test your patience during peak hours. Overall, if you're willing to wait a little longer for exceptional flavors, it's worth a visit.",2

"Swagat, a renowned restaurant in the area, is known for offering an exceptional dining experience. This establishment is celebrated for its exquisite preparation of Paneer and Butter Chicken, making it the go-to destination for those seeking the finest culinary delights in the vicinity. With its delectable offerings and inviting ambiance, Swagat is undeniably a prime choice for an enjoyable and satisfying dining experience",2
"Worst food. I visited here on 31st August 2023 to celebrate my brother‚Äôs birthday. The quality has deteriorated to a great extent. Even the behaviour of the staff was not at all good as it used to be earlier. The soup was too salty, dal-e-swagati was stale, and the paneer was half done. The breads have lost their taste too. Please consider before visiting here because it‚Äôs on the expensive side. Instead, visit the Elante branch.",0
"Best place in Chandigarh for real North Indian cuisine, excellent starters , don‚Äôt miss Aloo Dilnaz, Palak kofta,Dum Aloo Kashmiri, the Daal  Makhani is out of the world . Don‚Äôt miss The special truth fruit Icecream and Gulab Jamboon of this place.",2
Very good quality food and great service provided by the restaurant. Must visit.,2
"The food  is really good and affordable. The staff is cooperative and well-spoken. Overall, i had a good experience here.",2
Swagath is one of the best restaurants in Chandigarh to visit especially for family get togethers. The place is most of the times full and you have to wait to get seated if not already made a reservation.The food is no doubt delicious and the service is really good. The ambience and the attention of staff really makes it worth a visit.Good variety of cuisines given the kind of setup and no compromise on quality or quantity. The pricing too is moderate.Keep it up!,2
Taste was good but prices were high and space was a bit small and very noisy because of the people gatheringsOne more thing that before going there kindly book the table as there is a lot of waiting but we went there without booking but still they adjusted and provided us table without any waiting. Mr. Sanjeev was very helpful.Vegetarian options: Subj biryani was very tasty and i highly recommend this,2
"You made my 70th birthday absolutely divine! I loved the food that i ordered and ended up over eating :) Malai kofta was the best and Garhwali dal was so uniquely yum! The wait time was a bit longer but as it is said "" Worth the wait"". Thank you",2
The food is so delicious that I visited this place thrice during my stay at Chandigarh. The staff is very polite and the place has a nice ambience to it. So good place to have food.,2
Nice ambious. Pleasant atmosphere.Food is delicious.Staff is helpful and obedient.Overall best experience.I would like to visit again.,2
Went for my Daughter's birthday üéÇüéâ,2
"Ambience, staff, service were  pretty decent.But the food is not doing justice to the price at which it is being served.Ordered Methi malai chicken... Tastes more like malai chicken with a sprinkle of methi to make it look green.Paneer kadipatha... could have been a flavour bomb but twas paneer tossed in chop masala with a garnish of fried curry leaves... Hardly any flavour of South. I am a lover of southern cuisine and have eaten where it was born, but this was no way near to it.Dal hyderabadi was decent... It has that tadka flavour in it...Sirka onion has no tartness in it... Just the purple color... May be the batch was new.Please justify the price... Will try mutton and other veg dishes next time...",1
"I had an exceptional dining experience at Swagath Restaurant. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth and hospitality. The ambiance was inviting, with elegant decor and soft lighting that set the perfect mood for the evening.The menu at Swagath is a culinary delight, offering a diverse selection of Indian dishes that cater to various tastes. I was particularly impressed with the freshness of the ingredients and the exquisite flavors that danced on my palate. The chefs at Swagath truly know their craft, and it was evident in every dish we ordered.I must commend the attentive and knowledgeable staff who guided us through the menu, suggesting the perfect wine pairings to complement our meal. Their service was impeccable, striking the right balance between attentiveness and allowing us to savor our meal at our own pace.The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the seafood specialties, which were cooked to perfection. The tandoori prawns were succulent and bursting with flavor, while the fish curry was a harmonious blend of spices and creaminess.To top it all off, the desserts were a sweet conclusion to our dining experience. The gulab jamun and mango kulfi were heavenly and left us craving for more.Swagath Restaurant not only excels in its culinary offerings but also in creating a memorable dining experience. It's a place where you can celebrate special occasions or simply indulge in exceptional Indian cuisine. I highly recommend Swagath to anyone looking for a gastronomic adventure that will leave a lasting impression.",2
I don't like the food quality here. I ordered 3 starters and out of them only 1 was good. Other too are either too salty or too much sweet.,0

The caf√© has a beautiful green and lush entrance that instantly impressed me. The staff, clearly trained to spot solo adventurers like me, offered a warm welcome. They must have known I was a serious cafe cartographer. They pointed me to the perfect one-person seating with that 'ideal' lighting for all my epic food photos.I spent a while reviewing the menu and finally decided to order the Greek pizza with a kiwi and strawberry smoothie. The pizza was a refreshing change from the usual round ones and quite fulfilling. The smoothie was a delightful and refreshing sip. It's worth noting that everything on the menu is on the pricier side, but that's understandable given the caf√©'s ambiance and rustic woody decor. Indoors, outdoors, you name it - they've got a spot for your victory dance or solo food ceremony. Celebrate like a pro, but remember, the food may or may not be your champion. I was amazed by the service. They came prepared with shiny cutlery, an arsenal of tissues, and enough water to hydrate a marathon runner. They even handed me a piece of bread like I'd just stumbled out of the desert. Now that's service!",1
"1. Food: If you prefer bland food with minimalist type quantities, this joint is your jam. But for the love of God if you have taste buds, you can forego this place.2. Drinks: Sangria was all I tried and it was, well , a Sangria3. Vibe: Dimly lit, decent decor, typical upscale vibes with nothing to separate it from counterparts.4. Value: If you have money to throw at problems, this is your nest, otherwise please try the next.5.Service: Spot onMe personally l, never going back.",1

"Cottage is a beautiful, ambient yet small cafe that boasts of presenting Italian, Mediterranean and a little Indian cuisine on platter with a recent new delicacies in the offing. On my recent visit, I tried veg empanadas, barley tomato soup and barley aranchini- all of which were absolutely delectable! And for the mains I had the takeaway order of the newly added mutton kosha with Indian flatbread which was alright.  The mocktails were okay too. I would have preferred them to be on lighter side of sweet though.My little pointer will be for the seating arrangement especially outdoors in this hot weather where no ample fans were provided (one short circuited right before us) or even AC that were found dysfunctional! As the inner seating is quite limited, it goes without saying that they need to buckle up with managing the the outdoor seating arrangement better.The staff though is prompt and polite however it would be nice if they are a bit more attentive towards the customers especially if they need something in between meals and drinks, because it took me a while to have their notice as the place is dim lit.However this place provides a calm, soothing ambience with a delectable culinary experience which needs to be on your calendar if you are ever around! üëçüèª",2
Best place to spend some time with friends especially for a date. The ambience is amazing. The staff is also so cooperative.,2
It‚Äôs a very calm and serene place . You will feel the different vintage vibes here . Food is awesome and the sitting place is very cozy and it‚Äôs a very good place for family dinner and also for romantic dates . I would recommend backyard sitting options for couplesYoutube : Ajju96Parking: Parking slots are available but only few cars could be parked in front of the Cottage restaurant .,2
"A great evening dining experience....Superb ambience, silent place to catch up with friends. the food was awesome, the portion size is enough for one person. so while ordering the starters and drinks ensure to take less portion so that you enjoy the main course. Courteous and friendly staff members.",2
"Such a nice restaurant, to spend time with your loved ones, food is owsum, with the topping of its ambiance, marvelous entry, and the service is very fast, easy to find the parking. Must try ,
Recommended for the couples.",2
"It is a very nice and cosy restaurant.Serves good Italian and middle Eastern food.Light music and dim lighting ooze up the mood. They have a beautiful backyard open seating , and a nice private dining area at back.Multiple seating spaces it what i liked most about the place.",2
"One of the best resturant in chandigarh and as good as their other restaurant virgin courtyard. I love both places , service and food.You will surely get a good experience here for food.",2
"Perfect place for a candle light date, has good vibe. Service is also very good. Book early for a better seating in a ""cottage"". We had pizza and garlic bread and some drinks. Drinks were decent but the food was really good.",2
"I hadn't had such great desserts anywhere in my life! Such great flavors, they provide European Mediterranean food so if you have any query related the item, the staff will surely help you out with a smile! the preparation took a little time but it was worth.

Beautiful place and extremely spacious. A nice modern but rustic look and the tables are spaced quite far from each other so you can hold private conversations softly without the need to shout. I believe the place has live music too sometimes. We had one vegetarian falafel and hummus starter and one full baby chicken roasted and believe me it was more than enough for three of us. We weren't too hungry but looking at the quantity of left overs I am sure it would have been sufficient even if we were famished. The quality of the food was excellent and the quantity too.Vegetarian options: Plenty of vegetarian options.,2
"Amazing place, fab ambience, gracious and courteous staff makes your expereince out of this world. Owing to the fact that place is so fab and amazing, one must look to book your table in advance specially on weekends else one may have to wait for quite sometime which may exceed to even an hour to find a place to sit. Amazing variety of drinks and food options.Whatever you will order as part of your meals, believe me the taste, the presentation, the aroma of the food, the courteous and assisting approach of serving staff and the overall ambience of the restro will make you feel elated and out of this world. Cozy and quite place with little bustle of chattering people which gets muffled under soothing music being played at the restro. A must visit and must go olace for anyone who is in tricity and looking for an extremely fine dine outing experience.",2
"The evening dipped in this amazing ambience. Small compact with perfectly dim light.
As soon as you will enter, they will provide with welcome treat. If you are looking for European style food, this is the place. Perfect place to go on date with loved ones.",2
Great ambiance and decor with indoor and outdoor seating. Extensive selection of European food but beer options were limited (might be a temporary thing). I enjoyed the crepe and coffee. Reasonably priced menu. Temperature check done at entrance (as COVID-19 precaution).,2
"A very peaceful and warm place with candle lighting amid a covered and an open sitting areas. Open areas are best suited for small gathering and parties. All the dishes are extremely drooling and offers a great experience for dinings! Most recommended place! Try : Cottage cheese filo parcels, flatbread pizza, Mac and cheese, Guava politan, Orange punch.Ambience 5/5Food 5/5Vibes 5/5",2
Cottage is located at one of the Finest location in Chandigarh in sector 7 Chandigarh. The place has great ambience and I was frankly surprised to see how beautiful and simple the place was. Drinks I ordered were all satisfactory but the food was just average not bad but average had ordered Mac and cheese from their main dishes but the cheese was not in sufficient quantity. The problem was not that the problem was explaining that to the manager believe it was a communication error. Rest All assured The place is wonderful and it‚Äôs a must go for people in Chandigarh. The places usually less crowded and has an ample parking.,2
The real food. The ambiance is super cosy.,2
"Perfect place for a romantic candle light dinner. The vibe and ambience of this place will be different in day and night. The entry to this place is from back side.Food is super yummy. But the issue is that for ones who are not much familiar with foreign cuisine will struggle through the Menu card, like I did.I took my fiancee to this place and she loved the place.",2
Everything is good the food is delicious I am just cutting out 1 star because of accommodation. Inside its really good but in outside sitting there are alot of flies which is really irritating and disappointing.,2
"First visit to this place and quite impressedThey not only checked our temperature but also made sure we sanitize our hands properly Thumbs up for thatüëçüèªNow the ambience is pretty good,We visited at night and looked pretty good with dim lights and candle lightComing to food we tried Cappuccino, Chicken and thyme soup,Roasted veggie pizza, Chicken Souvlaki and Penne alfredo pastaCoffe and soup were pretty good, Roasted veggie pizza had perfect thin crust with Fresh assorted veggies but could have been seasoned betterPenne alfredo tasted creamy and i must say pasta was cooked to perfection not over cooked nor under cooked.You have to pay extra if you want to add veggies to it,we did and they added ample amount of toppings and Quantity was good tooChicken Souvlaki was tender and Juicy,Pita along with it was Fresh and soft but Felt portion was less for the priceOverall it was a really good experience and enjoyed the FoodTaste 4/5Quality 4/5Quantity 4/5Hygiene 5/5Service 4/5",2
"Nice place with a great vibe.Good place to hangout with family and friends.They did Justice with the flavours and food, thanks team Cottage for having us‚ú®Small suggestion~Being an Architect and end user of this space lighting of your place is too low,if anyone can work on that, then this can also become one of the  ""Perfect picture place"" too.",2
"Went there with my wife and best friend. It was a wonderful experience. The ambiance, food, beverages, staff, hygiene; everything was great and it wasn't really expensive either. For the amount of food we ordered the bill was quite genuine. I recommend visiting this place especially with your spouse/girlfriend.",2

Decided to come again thinking one should give it another chance. The experience again was the same. So, Come here, click some photos and go to some other place for  good experience.Cheers!",0
"The only thing I like of this restaurant is their environment and the candle light theme. The quality of food is really so bad with a very high price and they have very small menu. We ordered some dishes like pizza, pasta etc but we didnt like the taste of a single dish. The hospitality of the staff is really great but other experience is not so good.",0
Very nice and cute restaurant with a good collection of Italian food and a complete bar! Comfortable and well-lit ambiance. Worth a visit!,2
Very warm and unique ambience inside the cottage. I felt a European touch. Good food and fine dining.,2
Perfect Place for a lunch date with amazing interiors that manages to maintain an old school charm. The staff is courteous and friendly and would make sure you get your drinks the way you want them.,2
"They serve such authentic food and it tastes so good we tried their basil pizza ,alio-e-olioIt was yumVegetarian options: They used veggies like broccoli,basil,cherry tomatoes which are good for health as well",2

There's only one with quite overpowering spinach flavour.Parking: The entrance is at the back of the market. Enter from the parking gate that is right in front of the restaurant. Ample parking available. ",2
"After long, visited a restaurant where the taste of the food was equally good,as compared to it's ambience üòäTheir chef is experienced and a pro in the field and the rates are justified to the quantity and the quality ü§òTheir welcome bread and dip was delicious with balanced flavours and seasoningKeep up the good work üëç",2
It's definitely an insta-worthy place. Drinks were good. Food wasn't up to the mark.,1
"Once you step in to this place you will feel the romantic vibe....it's beautifully decorated with indoor plants and white curtains.It's a perfect place to spend some special time with your partner.They have a huge seating space as they have three sections - first when you enter, there is three table spots decorated with curled green plants and white curtains.Second, in the left side they have 4 tables and third they have quite huge outside space too to relish candle light dinner with your friends, family and partner",2
"Located in the corner of the busy sector 26 pub lane. Visited this place multiple times and it didn't disappoint me. Cottage has varied variety of seatings which makes it very versatile and beautiful all the more. The ambience is just perfect for any occasion. I tried their boat pizzas, empanadas, veg patties, enchilada and many other things in the menu. Every single dish was delicious. The empanadas are a must try, they just melt in your mouth and have a crunchy texture from outside, so its just perfect.The dip they serve with the breads (complimentary) is a must try.The kiwi and lemongrass coolers were refreshing. Chilli mocktail is a must try too.The LIIT has proper proportion and overall i would say they are doing a great job! The staff was courteous and the service time was average.A must to visit place in Chandigarh.",2

The designer has created a bespoke place, every spot is camera-worthy. My eyes kept rolling around the whole time.",2
"A quite and cozy place to spend quality time. Food, ambiance, service and vibes of the place is so good.",2
"A quiet and cosy place located on madhya marg. This place is a must visit if you are planning to spend good quality time with your partner. I feel it's a bit overpriced restaurant, and the quality of food served didn't match my expectations, so rated it 4star. The staff, ambience, and menu options get full marks. Surely, it is a place which can be visited again and again after every few months.",2
Good for candle lit dinner.  Good was satisfactory. Ambience was nice. Yes the lighting can be improved. Good for dates and family dinners,2
"I liked the vibe of the place.. if you want to have a calm and lunch date kind of place, this is perfect.Very calm atmosphere and you can sit and relax for quite a while with amazing food and vibe.. cons can be ac is kept a bit low ... Music can be made a bit high, so it can add to the beauty of the place",2
"The food was not great,it was as if having the food in any ordinary cafe.The ambience and the service though was good.The prices according to the food served did not match up.",1
"We decided to go for lunch to Dastan but we see this place too and thought it will be good, but it turns out to be wrong desicion as entrance has patio entrance but it was empty then the ambience in the restaurant was ok becz one side of the place filled with racks filled with books and decor items eating dust  even speakers on corner never seen cleaning. We ordered soup was watery and not even severed balanced and then the bread was offered on the house with butter which don't hav any taste of butter in it. The only thing is ok which final course meal and but that also ruined by the the dessert served with alot of rasberry juice. Just ambience is not serves for customers. Definitely will not visit again.DISAPPOINTINGüòîüòî",0

Food was average but place was good,2
Nice ambience with tasty food. Quantity of food is also good. I ordered one dal makhani and that was enough for 3 to 4 people.Vegetarian options: Enough amount of options to select from.,2
The quality of the food is excellent but I strongly suggest they should upgrade the menu as they have the same couple of dishes.,2
"Peaceful environment, services are really great, Food is really satisfying , Best time to go is evening time , Aesthetic feeling üíólove it",2

"Nothing wrong with the food and service. However, the approach to restaurant is not elderly friendly, the AC was not cooling, staff was struggling to install a free  standing fan to fulfill the needs of all customers, there were small cockroaches on the table. I believe a gentleman Mr. Arora is the owner of the place, he puts efforts and resolves the above.Wheelchair accessibility: Non existent",1
"Good food, good vibe and specially their music collection is super cool. Very delightful for romantic evenings. Beautifully designed place. Must visit place ‚ù§Ô∏è",2
"Excellent ambience for people who like a bit of nice and quiet while eating. Enough space between tables to give you privacy, soft background music helps. Overall a homely dining experience. Doesn't hurt that the food and service both are decent. Ultimately it gets a bot heavy on the pocket, but then it would be more often than not be worth it.",2
"The ambience was great and  food tasted moderately, when it comes to price they‚Äôre more at higher side according to their taste, the place take care of hygi√´ne very well and the service was very professional, so if u wanna go on a date with your love then its a must go place but take care if your pocket !",2

Good ambience. Food is good.,2
"Worst experience ever!!!
Ordered Alfredo pasta which was served raw totally not worth it! Also ordered coffee that was too much sugary and just overpriced!!",0
The ambience is really commendable. The staff delivery was fast and courteous to the customers.,2
Very poor service even there is no manager in the resturant for the complaint.one waiter is their he said he is the manger of the restaurant.after complaint he had not done any thing. I wasted by 2100 yesterdayPoor service and staffDon't waste your moneyVegetarian options: Poor food,0
"Lovely place with a great ambience and very polite staff. Food is great and so are the drinks. We opted for a Mac and cheese gratin and a lemony ginger mocktail and both were great. Even the non veg options, specially sandwiches are awesome. All in all a great experience.",2
Ambiance is warm and cozzy also a bit different.Provide continental food must try.Prices felt a bit high.One of the best cafe/resturant you must visit in Chandigarh,2
"Such an amazing ambience, one can fall in love with this place so easily... it was the day time when we visited still it had the charm wondering what the night would be like in here!!",2
Great Ambience and quality food. Definitely recommended,2
This place follows a tiring and sad chandigarh trend for cafes ‚Äî wonderful ambiance but forgettable food. Their coffee is nice.,1
"Splendid experience. The decor, ambience, service, and most importantly the tastefully done food - this place brought back memories from a classy European restaurant I am fond of in San Diego.When a restaurant is able to elevate your experience by not only matching your expectations but going beyond it - that's when revolutionary restaurant experiences are created. Kudos to the entire team at Cottage to pull this off in Chandigarh !Vegetarian options: Delightful soups and salads",2
"Three stars for the ambience , well it's a personal choice tbh , but the mocktails were good specially passion fruit . Welcome bread was served with humus . Taste ok .",1
I visited cottage like a month ago. I tired pasta over there. The food taste is great but the items on the menu are quite less in number. So it becomes hard to try something new. Though they serve yummy break with dip as a complementary item. It was yummy too.,1
Beat food and ambience. Never fails to impress. Feels like you are somewhere near coastal line.,2
"Never suggesting this to anyone ever. I‚Äôm a college student, the ambience is pretty aesthetic but the food is really awful served at very expensive rates and food quantity is really less. I do visit a lot of fine dining restaurants but they atleast have a good quality food which is pretty acceptable when served at a higher price including ambience and the atmosphere served. But this place is really bad and overrated. Felt they served a raw pizza with Sauce and cheese. Pizza quality was really bad and not cooked properly. Ordered a lot of drinks when we went there, felt none of them to be genuinely good. A normal cafe or a juice shop could serve better Oreo shake than them. Not at all worth. Really regretting visiting here.",0
Nice food and nice place to enjoy lovely evening,2
"The food quality was really bad. Not worth the price at all. We were eleven people and ordered three pizzas, two pastas and some drinks cause we weren‚Äôt much hungry but when we tried the food quality was really bad. Pizza base wasn‚Äôt cooked properly. Seemed like they served raw pizza base with sauce and cheese. Pizza didn‚Äôt seem fresh, didn‚Äôt like pizza or even pasta was very normal like if served at a normal family restaurant but we got bill for 5500 and was the worst experience I had there. The place ambience is indeed good but felt like we spent 5500 for just the ambience. We are college students and would probably never visit the place again or suggest anyone to. It‚Äôs very overrated.",0
"A beautiful place to for date , lovebirds, romantic place",2
"I did like the ambience. The food was well cooked too. Hospitality - A1! It was a good experience overall. Although, the quantity of the cocktail could have been a little more.",2
"What a quite and calm place
A must visit place
The ambience is very beautiful
I ordered smokey chicken pizza it was delicious.",2
"Delicious Italian food with aesthetic ambience ‚ú®
Better to call and reserve seats on weekends   ",2
"Good food, great ambiance, but I personally prefer Dastaan which is immediately next door to the cottage - and has much better food and beverage options",2
"Good environment for spending time, but not that worth the money .",2
"Food üëå

Best and courteous staff in tricity. They give you full fine dine feel. Love visiting this place.",2
"First of all, it's an objectively beautiful diner. The food is easy on the tongue, the service is pretty quick, the staff is polite, and the ambience is just perfect. But, it's a place that serves a couple niches. A date? No brainer, 10/10. A family Dinner? Absolutely, 10/10. An evening out for yourself? Hallelujah, 10/10. An evening outing with friends? Probably not the best place for it. Definitely not a cheap place, but in my personal opinion, it's worth the price.",2
"I found the food to be just average. It has a nice ambience and the staff were friendly but the food was just average in taste. I had heard many rave reviews and came for my wife's birthday party, but was disappointed in the quality of food. The harissa paneer was underwhelming, the guacamole toasts were small and unsatisfying. I enjoyed the mac and cheese pasta, and the pot pie was interesting but not quite accurate. Having couscous inside sort of spoiled the flavor of it. The flat bread pizza was bland. And the mulled wine overpriced and just so so. We tried about 8 items. If you are not picky about your food this is a great date place, but if you are looking for a great meal. Their are better places out there",1
"Courteous staff, great service, food was good but small portions.",2
"Finding a place for a date night in chandigarh is overkill, Since social media has taken over word of decorated reel with music make one persuaded to visit a place and i am glad i landed on The cottage sec 7 for anniversary date night.Excellent food, Excellent cocktails, plenty  of decor...A must visit for a romantic dinnerPS - moderate quantity of servings with  ample flavours in food will be good enough if matched with a tasteful cocktail.Vegetarian options: 3 out of 10 options are vegetarian but i guess it is fair to this place as they know how to cook meat.Parking: back of the sec 7 area.Kid-friendliness: peaceful place with plentiful corners.Wheelchair accessibility: easily accessible.",2
Wow‚Ä¶. Just superb.. i will definitely visit again,2
Nice concept but something which is quite common in that area. The food is decent but lacks variety.,1
Very good food ..great ambience .. evening visits should be preferable.,2
Beautiful place good food and heaven for people who want to read books. They have a great book corner,2
"Its my soulful favourite place to go with its exotic yet earthy ambiance, especially love its indoor green creepers over the sitting & the ‚Äòsocial solitude‚Äô it offers to have personal time with self or your loved ones! And of course the food is AWESOME ALWAYS & you can never go wrong here!! This time on my Birthday‚Ä¶i loved their pizza which I ordered for the first time‚Ä¶it was certainly THE BEST PIZZA ever & loved their gesture to celebrate my birthday with their opera cake!",2
"Absolutely amazing. I have heard so much about Ovenfresh but I never got the opportunity to go there because of the long waiting queues.  I finally went there on a weekday and it was worth the hype. They serve one of the tastiest pizzas I have ever had. Yes, the place is crowded but food compensates for it all.Adding this part of the review after my second visit--This time we tried their baked pasta and oh my God, it was so delicious that words aren't enough to explain. It was like heaven for cheese lovers. Those long strings of cheese and the oh so good garlic bread is a match made in heaven. Definitely give it a try.Their drinks are worth trying as well. I had their caramel coffee and it checked all the right boxes.* Pro tip* - once you have sat there and ordered your food, it takes around 30 something minutes. Meanwhile you can ask for complimentary chips. They will bring you chips and coleslaw completely free of cost. You munch on it till your food arrives.",2
"Our go to place for breakfast in Chandigarh. Love their English breakfast, pizza and sandwiches. Head to this cozy cafe next time when you are looking for a breakfast spot with good ambiance but expect long waiting queues.",2
Premium taste || Huge RushThis place got all amazing food options available including veg and non veg stuff.My favorite was grill fish with lemon sauce and juicy Chiken.Taste is amazing but this place is over crowded and they have one washroom which is always occupied.Overall fine place for a quick bitePaid parking is available at only 14 bucks .Dietary restrictions: Diet food available but not categorized,2
"My go to place in Chandigarh. The sizzler was perfectly cooked, sizzling with flavor and served with a delightful array of vegetables. The club sandwich was a true highlight. Overall experience was good",2
Tasty and wholesome popular food items that are filling and super tasty. Many are freshly prepared. Though the wait to get in the cafe and the food is a little more than other similar outlets but  good ambiance and food makes up for it . Clean toilet is also a plus,2
Amazing Pasta! I have been there multiple times and haven't got bored of it yet. This place is slightly on the pricier side but the food they serve is the best I've had in Chandigarh!,2
This place is always bustling with crowd. It is a family place. I loved their garden fresh pizza. It was too yum. We also tried their Baked broccoli alfredo pasta which was equally delicious. We also ordered penne arabiatta pasta but we didn‚Äôt like it much. The other two dishes tasted much better. We paired it with three different types  of frappe coffee‚Äôs which were amazing too. Would highly recommend visiting this place when in 35 sector.,2
"Ovenfresh is a chandigarh‚Äôs must. If you start with cafes, ovenfresh is the most basic and the one you absolutely start with. Been eating here for years. Got famous from its epic grilled sandwich n cold coffee, so that‚Äôs a must try. And now menu is full with dishes. Try any and it‚Äôs great!!",2
I was in Chandigarh for two days in the month of May and got an opportunity to visit this restaurant for lunch. I had an amazing experience and the food here is absolutely delicious. (No wonder the place is always fully booked) The quantity is a lot compared to the price. It was so much for both of us that we couldn't finish it. The garlic bread was perfect and the pasta was very very good. I definately recommend it for outstation people also who have come to explore chandigarh as a tourist. The staff is also very cooperative and humble. Will surely go here the next time I am in Chandigarh again.,2
"I had a fantastic dining experience at this food outlet! The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äì the tastiest pasta I've ever had, and I couldn't get enough of the Alfredo mushroom sandwich ‚Äì it was a delightful treat. The portion sizes were just right, with the Alfredo sandwich being perfect for sharing between two people.The penne pink sauce pasta was also great, and the portion size was adequate for one person. The flavors were spot-on, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.While the food was fantastic, I did encounter a couple of cons. There were some availability issues with certain items, and the waiting time after placing the order was a bit longer than I'd prefer. However, these minor inconveniences were overshadowed by the incredible taste of the food. Definitely worth a visit for a scrumptious meal!",2
"I've dined here at multiple occasions, and I can say with confidence that they will never disappoint you with their service and taste. Oven fresh has a very lively and happening ambience. Service is good and they maintain a very hygenic environment. Staff behaviour is very good. However, the primary reason to visit this place is its taste. Although the full menu is worth giving a try, I like their pizzas (especially Garden Fresh) and sizzlers (cottage cheese).I have to say the taste was very unique as compared to pizzas at other places. Furthermore, the menu is relatively cost-effective. In comparison to food items, beverages are just average. Expect a waiting time of 15-20 mins on weekends and rush hours.",2
"Experience was superb. It has a great vibe. Food served is really very tasty.

Vegetarian options: Their sizzler is a must try. Great sizzler and their cheesecakes are super yummy fresh and tasty.",2
"1st time in Chandigarh for a few years, this place is very hip  and lively, full of uni and college students. Food is excellant and well presented, must be 15+ waiters for all the tables. Food arrived quickly relative to how busy it was. The garlic bread is great and so is the kiwi smootie",2

"It's junk food alright but the taste is worth it.The place is too popular so can't expect exceptional customer service, just the norms are met.Will visit again.",2
"This restaurant is celebrated for its fresh, high-quality food, attracting a youthful crowd. However, its popularity also means it often feels overcrowded and stuffy, especially during peak times. For those seeking a quieter dining experience, visiting during the lean hours of 4 pm to 7 pm is advisable, as it's less congested. Although the vibrant atmosphere is a draw for many, the wait outside for a table can be a drawback. Balancing the allure of its culinary offerings with the challenges of a busy environment, timing your visit can significantly enhance your experience at this bustling eatery.",2
"Oven Fresh in Chandigarh offers an extraordinary culinary experience with its delectable dishes. The taste is truly awesome, showcasing a perfect blend of flavors that leave a lasting impression. The restaurant's commitment to freshness is evident in every bite, making it a must-visit for those seeking a delightful dining experience.",2
"Amazing food.Drinks are above average.Ambience is too noisy.Visited on Saturday evening:Waiting period of 40 mins to get a tableOrder Chicken Tikka Pizza and Sphegetti Pasta.Pizza arrived in 20 mins, awesome taste so worth the wait.Pasta arrived after 70 mins of ordering, tasted good but not worth the wait.If only service could have been faster, would have given 5 stars.",1
"Food quality is really Awesome. I went there on the weekend, Service is slow, maybe due to crowd on weekends.
Took half hour to serve order.",2
"A great place to hang out. I loved the food. Personally speaking, the food was perfection. I believe they have perfected their art over a decade or so... I would highly recommend this place to everyone. Also it is situated at a great location. I can gurantee you that you will love this place. The portion of food is also quite heavy so do remember that before ordering.",2
Pasta was sooooo gud. The tastiest pasta I ever had. Quality and Quantity is also gud. Must visit.,2
"Extremely oily food. I ordered Mexican heat wave, pizza was average. Do not recommend ovenfresh. Also very expensive for the quality and quantity.",0
Food was awesome. Service was exceptional.atmoshphere was excellent. I have ordered pizza and some drinks there . And all was very delicious. I will highly recommend,2
"Best food ever, I can drive from dilli just to have their alfredo pasta",2
Amazing food over here.Liked it so much that I visited twice in a fortnight along with my family.You have to order at the counter.Can implement a system for ordering & paying from your table itself after scanning the menu.Slightly cramped but ok.They do not book a table over the phone. You have to physically get it noted in the register maintained outside.Food is really great üëç,2
They take time to serve but when they serve its worth waiting. We had Arrabiata pasta and veg enchilada with Mango slurry and virgin mojito. The washroom was very dirty. Rest the location is very good. I love the place.,2
"Best of the best food in Chandigarh. Everything is top notch in taste, quality and quantity",2
"The quantity of food and the flavours are humongous. If you have got company of 5, ordering 3 to 4 dishes would be enough.
4 stars because of the delay. We waited for 20 mins to get a table and then waited for 40 mins to get our food. The place is always busy.",2
"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at Oven Fresh, and while the wait time was longer than anticipated, the food was undeniably worth it. The experience left me thoroughly satisfied, and I am eager to share my thoughts on this delightful restaurant.Upon arriving at Oven Fresh, I was excited to indulge in their renowned cuisine. However, it's important to note that there was a significant wait for both seating and placing an order. While this may seem like a drawback, I assure you that the wait was ultimately rewarded with an exceptional dining experience.",2
Interesting place. Food is good though felt a little over priced. Service is good.,2
"Amazing place to have a fresh baked stuff and finger licking food. Although the prices on the higher side but after eating you won't repent whatever you have spent. Had a wonderful feeling to dine here. Great ambiance. Waiting period is more than half an hour atleast to enter to the restaurant. Again take 45-50 minutes for preparing the food. Self ordering and payment should be on the table. This can save the time. Rest all okay - fantastic menu, delicious and yummy food, value for money etc etc",2
"Undisputed champion for serving the tastiest treats in the tricity. Some of my hot favourites are Achari Pizza, Mushroom Garlic Bread and Green Thai Curry. Unfortunately the place is always full so expect some wait time for entering.",2
"Pizza is a must try. But it's too crowded and noisy on weekends. The table we got was at last , I felt suffocated.",2
Really nice restaurant. Nice ambience. Nice food. Chicken cheese Sandwich is like it's speciality. Chicken puff is great. I didn't like it's pizzas much but Sandwich is mouth watering and tempting. It offers you wide range of beverages whether you want hot or cold. Deserts are also good.,2
Recently been to this place after long time. Quality has degraded pink sauce pasta was excellent but the pizza and hazelnut coffee below average. No fragrance of hazelnut just a regular coffee pizza doesn't taste good. Fried fish with finger chips was ok ok sorts.,1
Awesome taste and ambience but you have to wait for the table,2
"Food is good, atmosphere is also good, the only problem is you have to wait for someone to leave to get free table.",2
"If you like cheese then this is the place.
Note - not every cheesy food is invented in Italy, here they have customised with Indian flavours so order carefully!",1
"Sizzler and Mojito are my favourite meal that I order every time I visit here ‚Ä¶..I love the place for its exceptional prepration
And yes the aroma of baked pasta is always mesmerising‚Ä¶",2
"I recently visited this place and wanted to share my experience. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. We ordered the garden fresh pizza and alfredo pasta, but they didn't turn out as we hoped. The pizza was too cheesy, even though we asked for less cheese, and the pasta wasn't fully cooked. The sauce also seemed undercooked. It was such a disappointment that I literally left my whole pasta. On top of that, the waiting time was longer than expected, and the service was quite slow. It really affected my appetite. Overall, it was a disappointing visit.",0
"Oven Fresh is a very awesome place for Family and Friends, Pizzaüçï Pasta and Garlic Bread is very delicious. And I haven't eaten such Italian food anywhere else in chandigarh. I like this place. üòçü§§",2
"I had a fantastic experience at this food outlet...The penne pink sauce pasta was great, and the portion size was adequate for one person and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the waiting time after placing the order was a bit longer than I'd prefer. However, these minor inconveniences were overshadowed by the incredible taste of the food. Definitely worth a visit...",2
It‚Äôs a must visit place in chandigarh. I visited this restaurant 3-4 times and all the time food was very good. Weekend‚Äôs are little bit crowded so sometimes you have to wait for table. You can try their English breakfast and chicken tikka garlic bread. Smoothie‚Äôs and shakes are also very good.,2
"Visited for lunch at 2:45pm on Thursday, immediate seating. Weekend has waiting up to 45mins.Food had: Four season pizza, penne pastaFood: 5/5, bang for your buck, taste, portion, all brilliant.Service: 5/5Accessibility: sector 35, ample parkingRecommendation: try and arrive at non peak hour for speedy service",2
Unnecessarily hyped.It's self service and yet so expensive.You have to wait at least an hour for food which is just above average.The prices can be reduced and the service can be made better.,1
This place has the best Italian food.All items a prepared fresh and so the waiting time is 30-40 minutes. But the quality and taste compensates for the wait.The staff is also courteous.Weekends are crowded so plan accordingly.,2
Visited this outlet after almost 28 years. Still the same quality.Fantastic food. Straight from oven. Large portions. Excellent preparation. Very soft spoken staff.Nice ambience. Must visit once in Chandigarh.Sector 35 outlet is the flagship one for Ovenfresh.,2
"Tried calling number for advance booking and no one answered my call.Changing rating to 5 star.I visited there, waited for 30 minutes or so before my number to get in, then again waited for 15-20 minutes inside for the food. But, food compensates all the waiting. Tried their pizza, it was one of the best I ever had! Pasta was served with a big bread stick",2
"Oven fresh is supposed to be in the Must Visit List in Chandigarh for an amazing breakfast, lunch or dinner. You can go to this place anytime and you will not be disappointed. On my very recent visit we had stuffed chicken sizzler and garden fresh pizza and some shakes. We were full by the time we finished the sizzler (aptly says serves 2) and craving for more. The portions of meals are totally worth the price. The ambience and staff are really good. Visit here with family or friends you will always enjoy.",2
"The food was amazing, and each plate had generous quantities for 2 people. Each dish and drink was yummilicios and was authentic to Italian taste. I would go everytime I would be in Chandigarh. But one thing that bothered me was that it was a bit noisy and cramped for the space they had.",2
"Having heard about this place ample of times, I visited this place to have a pre-birthday dinner. So here are some of my observations:1. Firstly, whenever you plan to visit this place either on weekends or weekdays, there is a long queue of people waiting to get the access to the restaurant. It might be due to COVID restrictions but pre COVID also, the situation here was pretty much the same. In the past two instance, we left after waiting for half an hour. So, according to me, point no.2 is reason for the same.2. The moment you get access to the arrangements, you ll order and then wait for again 40-45 minutes for the order to get delivered to the table. The service is too slow man. This might also be the reason why people keep waiting outside coz those inside does not get their orders on time.3. The staff is good , professional and cooperative.4. The ambiance is above average. Though the sitting arrangement seemed to be tight and not that comfortable.5. The food is worth it. Chicken Garlic bread is good. Enchiladas were fine. The blue drink in the pic was good. But ya the mochachillo requires much efforts to finish off. It wasn‚Äôt up to the mark. Food presentation was good.6. The hygiene is kept at a higher priority and also the place is clean and organised overall.7. The quantity of the food was satisfactory. The pricing is also reasonable.I hope the points I delineated are helpful for the visitors as well as owners.",1
"Garden Fresh Pizza and Penne Broccoli Primavera Pasta with cold coffee, Its was yummy, A perfect mix of vegetables and spices.",2
"Oven Fresh, a great place to visit with your friends and family. Interior is awesome, staff is friendly and 100% cleanliness.Everything prepared is fresh and tasty, not matter what you order it will not disappoint you. The quantity served is also great and not heavy on your pockets as well. I recommend this place to everyone who needs to chill out with friends and want to enjoy good meal as well. Thanks to Oven Fresh.",2
Fantastic taste. Difficult to get a table.,2
"This place needs no introduction.Every item has unique and distinctive, Authentic taste which is very special.The food quality to price ratio is amazing as one item can easily serve three people.The place has an amazing decor, soft music, great ambiance and gentle crowd.The staff is welcoming, humble and great in doing their work professionally.Food orders can take some time to prepare as Everything is prepared fresh but It's worth the wait so no star cutting for this.Overall 100/100, The place I always go to when I am in Chandigarh.",2
"Yum food, filling to the max. Enough for two. Nice staff. No congestion. Food preparation took very long. I think they forgot our drinks, had to remind them to bring them out. It's a bit on the pricey side.This is me visiting here (sector 35 outlet) again. Love the place, hate the music and noise. It was prime dine time. So the place was a bit crowded than normal. Food again was simply delicious. Again the drinks came after food. I ordered Thai basil curry (green), it's kind of become my 'usual' and for drinks I had true blue which I am not ordering again ever !I forgot to click a pic before starting (sorry not sorry!)",2
"HANDS DOWN, OVEN FRESH SERVES THE BEST FOOD IN CHANDIGARH!!! Must try sizzlers and pastas.I've been so so many cafes and restaurants and NO RESTAURANT offers this kind of food with tremendous taste, quality and quantity. I've never regretted any penny spent here. Each bite is worth its price. A little advice, the food is heavy and the quantity is good and I've often ended up ordering more than I could eat. So order less.",2
Yummy food but alyz have to wait for order . Most of the time it's overcrowded. But food is worth to wait for.,2
I went to Chandigarh for and official work and I had my meal at Oven Fresh and I found it so amazing I tried various meal over 3 day and everything is too good.As per my review on the below pointers:-Ambience - 9 out of 10Food - 9 out of 10Parking - 9 out of 10Hygiene - 9 out of 10Prices - 9 out of 10,2
"The food is awesome with great vibe. Have visited the place too many times. The price is little on the higher end but the taste compensates that. Weekends have long waiting period, hence they must work to expand their seating capacity.",2
"Pizzas and Garlic bread were very nice.The 11inch Pizza is good for 2 persons with average appetite.The water they provide is flavoured with carrots , cucumber and some herbs, which feels good.But the Grilled Chicken we ordere was not good.Overall a good place to go , but there is a waiting even on the weekdays.",2
"Has become a bit more crowded than before. Food quality is still at top ‚ù§Ô∏èMy choice: The roasted chicken, Blueberry cheese cake, BBQ Chicken Alfredo Pasta.Btw I've liked everything I had tasted here ‚ò∫Ô∏è",2
The quality is a bit different now but overall good value for money,2
Amazing Amazing food. We had Pizzas and Pastas and both of them were top notch quality. Definitely recommended. üëçüëç,2
"I went on a Sunday, and thankgod it wasn't packed because of the India v Pakistan match. This whole place is usually packed on weekend, their food is delicious but their service takes around 20 to 30 minutes yet it is totally worth it.üòÖ I ordered Garlic bread with cheese, Pasta Alfredo and Stuffed chicken sizzler with mushroom jus.‚ú® And a glass of coke.Pasta Alfredo was super creamy and cheesy, and the sizzler was mind blowing!   ",2
One of the Greatest and busiest cafe's in Chandigarh. A must visit place to enjoy the best italian that is served here. Must try things are veg pizza & sizzler. Fruit punch is a healthy delight. As the place is busy so it's not quiet there to have peaceful time but it's best for italian lovers.,2
"Wonderfully cheesy pizza and delicious sizzlers. Having said that, a thin crust option on the pizza would be appreciated.",2
"Food is quite good here but the only demerit lies in long waiting.
For first timers- please be at the restaurant at least 30 minutes early than your schedule.",2
"TOO MUCH OILThis was the first time I tried oven fresh and i was expecting the food to be good. Pasta was alright but the bread which came with the pasta had too much oil in it and it felt like any other cheap bread one can get in the market.The pizza, it was literally dripping with oil, like they deep fried it and didn't even let the oil drip out before serving. Did not looked appetizing in the least. Maybe it's because it was Sunday and there were quite a lot of people which made the chef's rush everything leading to this disaster. I would try this place again on a weekday ig but it has left a bad impression.The prices here are identical to that of Nando's(Elante) yet the quality of food has quite a difference. The dishes were certainly not worth their prices in oven fresh.",1
The place is fab. Everything is fantastic. The pizza omg ‚ù§Ô∏è. Garlic bread is delicious too. But the only con is there is alot of waiting. Because every time u go there it is almost full.,2
This place has classy vibes and perfect interior design has made the best possible use of space.Some things out of my observation are as: -* Staff- Sense of ownership in their work.* Sanitation - Before and right after your meal.* Software Interface - A little tricky for the first timer but manageable.* Food   - Perfect taste and right quantity.* Music - Soft (favourable for official meetings as well)* Washroom - Neat and clean (Comfortable for any gender),2
"Delicious food, waiting time is approx 20 mints but waiting is value for time",2
The food is very good.. The waiting is a big issue here as the restaurant is always busy...,2
"Most preferable place for Italian and other foreign foods for me.Authentic taste for Sizzlers, Thai curry and Pastas. Probably the best in tricity for this category of dishes.",2
"Very good food... no doubt, but only the long waiting time is mixed with average sitting setup, and the overall average class ambiance makes it down to 3 stars !  Because the customer is paying a premium price of the food but has average sitting comforts and long waitings too üòÑ",2
A good Cafe in the centre of the city with great grilled sandwiches and drinks menu. It's been renovated since my last visit and looks fresh and inviting. Overall the food was decent but the pricing is a bit on the higher end.,2
"One of the most lively place in Chandigarh, Always full of people and a long waiting list. Their wood-fired pizzas are needless to say the best in entire tricity. Cottage cheeze sizzler, Veg sizzler and Indonesian sizzlers are worth trying. They serve really great enchiladas and croissant sandwiches which isn't available at many places. Their baked pastas are a super specially the one with pink sauce. Really Long garlic breads. Amazing shakes and mojitos.Must try their Sizzling hot brownie with icecream.Recommended to everyone who visits Chandigarh to come here!Taste 5/5Ambience 4/5Cleanliness 5/5",2
Probably one the best place around there and there are some really good ones!..  great ambiance too! I think you can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the items on the menu! Their chicken is one of the best! and staff is quite humble too! Great place,2
The aura of this place hits different. Pasta and stuffed garlic bread were the items tried by me along with a kitkat shake. Every single bite was worth a penny.,2
"This is an all time favourite, the last best option that never fails type of place. The food is good, service is obviously very slow but they let you know upfront that the order will take some time so it sort of makes up for it and the food is usually on point. Be ready for a line if you visit on a weekend.",2
"Chicken & Cheese Sandwich @loveovenfreshOvenfesh introduced these Grilled Sandwiches back in 1995 I think, and since then they've been in a league of their own. Not comparable to any other in the Tricity.You won't get round huge slices of bread, laden with generous amounts of gooey melting cheese and more importantly you won't get that heavenly Coleslaw as a side (Not pictured ü§¶üèª). Infact sometimes I've just gotten the slaw packed to go. It's still as good as I remember from the mid 90's.The perfectly grilled bread, aptly seasoned shredded chicken with oodles of melting cheese works well with Indian Spiced Crinkled Crisps (Uncle Chips) further contrasted by the sweet-ish Slaw. A few flavours coming together, one after the other, has made this sandwich a favourite of mine. Tricity really doesn't have an alternative to Chicken Cheese or if you want to go easy on the Cheese get the Chicken Salad Sandwich. You've gotta get these!The weather is perfect for the Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwich. Well, If you don't feel like getting the Sandwich, I'd say, just go for that Coleslaw!!",2
"The ambience is great. Grey, good combination of ambience look amazing. There service is fast. They provide good quantity and quality food. There food and drink menu is amazing. Usually college going student love to hangout here. You must try there pasta and garden fresh pizza. The pasta sauce is amazing like think and creamy. Last time i first time try pesto (green sauce) pasta and it was amazing. A must recommended to all the foodies.",2
"One of my favourite places in tricity! Their portion sizes and food quality are wonderful. I absolutely LOVE their cheese garlic bread, truffle pastry and alfredo chicken spaghetti. They should start delivering food!Their mango shake was really bad though, it tasted like blended mango ice cream.",2
"If your looking for a perfect Cuisines it‚Äôs one  Of the best Italian food had so far in ChandigarhHygiene is decent , food is WOW!!Sizzler was decentBaked past was amazingRight flavours and right taste just the right balance of flavoursBread is so soft and fresh amazingLocated in Sector 35 ChandigarhBest time to visit is Dinner timeVery crowdedSo when you want to order your food you have to first order and pay first and get your order laterWaiting timing is long  was 40 mins and order and  waiting time to get your order in your table is 1/2 n hour",2
"One of the best places to have Italian and western cousine in town. Everything is so rich in terms of quality and quantity. Love especially their pastas, pizzas and sizzlers. They also have a huge range of cakes and pastries. Choco chip brownie and chocolate decadence are best.",2
"Amazing place with great food. Oven fresh never disappoints when food is concerned. They have the best pasta, pizza and soups. Shakes are good too but depends on how much you like chocolate.",2
"This place I love personally üòç whenever I hear this name my hunger start knocking the walls of my stomach. From quality to their quantity everything is beyond imagination. They know how to take care of their food lovers. Delecious taste , Best environment , co-operative staff and always at your service no need to shout at all. I even went here solo sometime just to enjoy their food ü§™@mr_sahil_walia (insta)",2
"Taste - 5/5Portions - 5/5Ambience - 3/5Service- 3/5Value for money - 4/5.One of the very few places where everything on the menu is delicious. Their Penne Alfredo is my absolute favourite and a must try. Their uncompromised taste over the years brings me back to this place every time.The waiting time and staff service are not something they excel at (due to being overcrowded), but the taste of the food overshadows everything else.Their pizza, garlic breads, thai curries, shakes and desserts everything is a big hit.",2
"Good food, wait time around 15 min on a weekday",2
"Always been a pleasure eating out at Ovenfresh. Whole of my family loves the place and so does the best of my friends. Everything is fantastic here, fresh, tasty and filling. My favourites are Brownie Sizzler, Grilled Sandwich and Pizza.",2
"Starting with food, it is relishing. After giving order it takes atleast 45mins to get the food serves.Now parking, it's your luck if you get parking (can't say more)Food is little over pricey, but yes quality has a price.",2
It was great just little bit populated as usual. We had pizza and fries which were good in taste. Also the staff is good and try to make reservation beforehand.,2
"The place ALWAYS has waiting and for good reason!The food tends to be heavy and portion sizes are large as well (we got five footlong-sized loaves in one order of garlic breads, see images attached!), so one should order accordingly.",2
"White Sauce Veg Penne Alfredo Pasta is way too amazing. So creamy, so fresh. This dish is a must try. Good quality food overall.Off late the rush has increased at their outlets. Its a good sign for business point of view but as a customer i personally feel annoyed when i have to stand in a queue and wait for 30-40 minutes just to enter.Pls think of opening more outlets or else consider delivering food online. This can reduce the workload because at some point of time you will loose regular customers who love the food served here but the wait kills the mood",2
Oven fresh can never disappoint us.Best place in Chandigarh even in whole Punjab.The Cream pasta the serve have no compitition at all.Just love the foood each and every dish from the menu,2
Has long waiting. But food is worth trying out. Tried the delicious parmesan chicken.,2
"Hands down, one of the best places in Chandigarh.. every single item is bang on! Must try: Mushroom Cheese Sandwich, White Sauce Pasta, Sizzlers!!!",2
Every dish is very tasty and environment is also very good. Staff is also very cooperative . Every table is cleaned and santized properly . Large variety of dishes are available and every item is tasty and yummy delicious. But everything is costly and not everyone can enjoy it,2
My experience was almost excellent except for the washroom. Poor lighting that I couldn‚Äôt even tell if the washroom was clean enough. There is no hand dryer machine. Only tissue box was there.I gave less stars so management can take up this issue seriously.,0
"Food was delicious and their prices are slightly hogh but the quantity and quality both were worth the price.
I will recommend you this place if you are going there in group.",2
Best pizza and past in chandigarh,2
Good food slooow service too crowded good ambience good music long lines and long wait times .. but worth the wait .. have fun.,2
Tastiest food ever more on the expensive side but worth spending money.,2
"Had a great experience here as the food was too good!!We ordered a pizza, garlic bread with chicken tikka pieces & a fresh lime soda!!!But my personal favourite was garlic bread with chicken tikka pieces. They were so filling & tasty that one couldn't finish it alone!!! There were 5-6 pieces of garlic bread topped with cheese, chicken tikka pieces!!! Now my mouth is watering !!! üòã.Had barbeque chicken Alfredo, one of the cold coffee here. I really loved the pasta that was so creamy, with little chicken pieces and is the best pasta I ever had. It is served the 2 bread sticks and is very well presented. Amust try for sure. But I didn't really like the coffee, it was not chilled, was too sweet for more and too much chocolatey and bitter.",2
Grilled sandwich.. ultimate and forever the best..!!!,2
"First of all, a big disclaimer. If you are visiting this outlet or even sector 26 outlet on weekends, be prepared to wait for a good 40-45 minutes. Talking about food, it absolutely scrumptious. Alfredo pene pasta is a delight to have. Food quality is incomparable. Service is a little on the slower side. Hence I have deducted one star because of the delay.",2
"Since childhood Oven Fresh has been my one of the favourites. You get amazing food for genuine prices. It‚Äôs a well built, neat and clean restaurant in the city centre of Chandigarh. You might see franchises in other sectors in the city but the he most popular one is in Sector 35. I usually eat Chicken Croissant, Four Seasons Chicken Pizza, White Sauce Pasta etc. Amazing ambience and delicious food. Don‚Äôt miss out on this if you are in Chandigarh ! Go for it",2
"This is an upscale bakery with all preparation in live kitchen.  no reheating of any product.  Pizzas , baked pasta and sizzler are must haves here. if not worried of calories then Fruit punch is nice option in Drinks.  jus t that they only have flavored drinksand not fresh fruit drinks except banana for which you wont like to spend Rs. 300. it is usually crowded and waiting is normal.  but certainly the visit and experience is worth.",2
best place for fast food lovers. awesome taste and served in very good manner.. Though you have to wait for your ordered  food but I must say your wait don't go waste as every item is so yum that you can't resist.. When I want to eat pizza my first preference is oven fresh.. As the name suggests everything is fresh and delicious üòã,2
"I guess Oven Fresh is the only place where you the get the best pizza of the tricity. The waiting time of each order is about 25-35 minutes but the taste is worth the wait. If it's your first time then do try Broccoli pasta and Pizza, veg/non-veg.",2
"Excellent place for a large range of soul food.Their burgers , fries , fish is top notch.Khao Sue needs to be less thick.Lasagne needs to have another layer or pasta. But both are yummy.Eggs Benedict, pancakes tops notch.Did not like the cinnamon ice cream..Waffles are ok. I make them better.Great place to go with kids.Quantity is large but the price is on the higher side.Love this place.",2
Decent cafe. Good and helpful staff. But I would stress on the need of educating the staff. They didn‚Äôt know the difference between Latte and a Cappuccino. When I stressed that my latte looks like a cappuccino they just added another expresso shot to itüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠. Overall decent experience,1
"Ah, such a chic and swanky cafe to be at. To run an open kitchen is difficult cause you‚Äôve got to make it look aesthetic and a bit theatrical at all points, and these guys do a great job of it. A morning visit here is worth it, I opted for the Philly Chicken Cheese Steak Sandwich, and it was perfectly filling and delightful. With Fresh Lime Water and a pancake stack on the side my breakfast couldn‚Äôt have gotten better. The Backpackers Classic Breakfast a.k.a Eggs to Order was also a good choice with hot chocolate drink on the side.Listening to them play La Vie En Rose, I decided that this cafe deserves a 5/5 for the overall hospitality. It is unfair of me to forget this name, but I called up the cafe, whilst writing this, just to confirm that his name was Mr. Harindar, because he had been a very very helpful gentleman.To sum it all up, a total must visit. They have a beautiful cafe, with lovely art surrounding the whole place. And a very calming, gentle atmosphere with sweet music crooning through the speakers and an open kitchen with chefs making it look like they were playing their parts in a movie.",2
"Backpackers Cafe, situated in Sector 8-C, Chandigarh, is an absolute delight! The cafe boasts ample space and a delightful ambience that's truly inviting. Our selection from their diverse menu included minestrone, exotic baked vegetables, bruschetta, margarita, alla Siciliano P, and tiramisu.This cafe truly stands out as a culinary treasure. The menu offers a delightful array of dishes, each one expertly prepared to deliver an unforgettable gastronomic experience. The flavours harmonize beautifully, leaving a lasting and impressive taste. The staff's hospitality is exemplary; they go the extra mile to ensure every dining experience is memorable. From their insightful recommendations to their prompt and attentive service, their dedication is commendable.The ambience of Backpackers Cafe further enhances its charm, creating a warm and welcoming setting. Whether you're a passionate foodie or simply seeking a delightful meal, this cafe excels in delivering outstanding food, impeccable service, and an extraordinary experience. The prices are moderate, akin to other cafes in Chandigarh, making it a worthwhile choice for the exceptional food and ambience it offers. Highly recommended for anyone in the Tricity area seeking top-notch dining experiences.",2
"What a delight to have this second branch open up which is more spacious, has more seating space inside and parking space outside. And the best part, the food and service is just as great! I come here for the chicken lasagne but this time the person waiting our table suggested Kock-a-Noodle soup which was also really good.",2
"Backpackers cafe is mushroomed all across the city. The vibe and the food are both good.The quantity can be a bit deceptive but the flavors were bang on. We loved the omelette, the sourdough and the hash browns.Unfortunately, the granola bowl was a bit disappointing because it wasn‚Äôt as crunchy and fresh. The yogurt that came with it was phenomenal.I‚Äôd certainly recommend and would be happy to return to this place.",2
"Backpackers Cafe is located at Sector 8-C in Chandigarh and it's an absolutely beautiful cafe! It's incredibly spacious with ample seating and the ambience is super enjoyable .I had ordered a Niscoise Salad, Pesto Tagliatelle Pasta and Creme Brulee. All the items were fresh, super tasty and the portion size is good for 2 people. The salad was light and the veggies were fresh. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was creamy and flavorful. The cream brulee was heavenly and the texture was silky and so enjoyable. The servers are nice and polite and the menu is extensive! A lot of good options to choose from.The prices are similar to any other cafe that you would visit in Chandigarh which are moderate. Definitely go for the food and ambience as it's top notch. Highly recommended in Tricity.",2
"We went there for breakfast. Like always this place never disappoints. Love their food and coffee. Must try, totally worth it.",2
Amazing food and excellent service. A tad bit loud but everything was par excellence.Dietary restrictions: Followed our vegan guidelines to the T.,2
Ordered quattro stagtoni named  pizza and as mentioned it should have sun dried tomatoes pepper and mushrooms and olives as i have asked not to put olives in that that was okay but instead of getting dried tomatoes which have far much better flavour nd might be cost  than normal tomatoes and they have put soo manu tomatoes in big cubes og normal tomatoes which was not ag good and this review is just for experience and had that and also paid the bill accordingly and i asked chef that you have not put sun dired tomatoes as mentioned he was telling me these normal tomatoes are sun dried only and we have this only with us i‚Äôm sharing this for the experience i had also sharing pictures and hope all those who explore for good food will understand,0
"This review is for sector 8C outlet. Ordered Quarttro Stagioni pizza which had no flavours, the base was pre-made that further added to the tastelessness of the pizza. The baked mashroom caps are overrated sm need not worth the hype. The ambience is great but no point spending so much just for it.",0

"Amazing experience..staff is very well trained, food is very tasty.. Smoothies are good, along with Cottage cheese steak. sandwiches are good too. Most of the menu items are good to eat..",2
"Such a gem in Chandigarh! We went for lunch at a friend‚Äôs suggestion & found the place packed. It‚Äôs a small space & our friend had warned us we may not get a table & she was right. Just as we were ready to walk out out, one became available. Lucky us. The menu has something for everyone. Omelettes, Pizza, pasta, sandwiches & Indian & western fast food. Four of us ordered & waited patiently for the food. Must say, we weren‚Äôt disappointed. Fresh, delicious lamb burger, chicken Caesar burger, hummus & falafel burger & Philly chicken cheese steak sandwich with coleslaw & French fries were gobbled up with great satisfaction! We thought we‚Äôd ordered too much but not a French fry was left on our plates. Kudos to the team behind this very popular cafe. FYI as we  were leaving, we saw some folks had ordered pizzas that looked absolutely delicious. Next time that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting!",2
"Loved the vibe of this small cafe with work class young crowd early on the tables to have their best available food. Masala omelette with bread, veg sandwiches and coffee is a must try and they provide complementary jam, Amul butter üëåüèº. Overall it should be your go to place when in Chandigarh",2
"It‚Äôs a beautiful cafe. The ambience is nice and is decorated with posters. The food is not that great. Order Lamb burger and was not good . The patty was not juicy. Costed me 550rs but had better burger from street vendors. Another dish was veggie pizza, worst than burger. Again charged me 550 for that horrible pizza. Funny part was they charged me 250 for 4 pieces of bacon which was the only item was properly cooked in the restaurant. Overall my experience was unpleasant and request everyone not to try this place.",0
"As a cafe lover I had very disappointing experience withüìçBackpackers cafe sector 8C.If you are only looking for good ambience and photogenic place then you can consider this, Otherwise as a food lover I will never  recommend anyone for wasting their money. Because food is not worthy enough for such a high prices. We had ordered Pizza and Mozzarella cheese balls. Pizza had a disaster taste and worst thin crust pizza base I ever had. On a other side Mozzarella cheese balls had filled with tiny drop of cheese. Very disappointed.",0
If you are craving for some English breakfast‚Ä¶. This place is the best for you‚Ä¶ No thrills and frills‚Ä¶ the place is for decent crowd‚Ä¶. The food is their plus point‚Ä¶.you can have a healthy conversation with your friends with a light background music‚Ä¶. No Punjabi/Bollywood songs‚Ä¶ this is the first preference of my Wolfpack‚Ä¶,2
"American vibes, food is upto the mark no flaws...Staff is very professional from front door to cheque..Ideal place for brunch at a weekend üëå",2
"Support staff is just incredible üëè. Chicken tikka, sandwiches and egg,  everything is just yummy üòãVegetarian options: They have all the options in veg as well as non veg.Dietary restrictions: If you ask them they will serve you diet foods.Parking: Near to gopal chandigarh.Kid-friendliness: Atmosphere of the place is very lively üëå. Many options of food which is loved by kids are there üòÄ",2
"Beautiful decor. Great food. Ordered grilled lamb and cheese burger, Alfredo pasta, and Quattro Stagioni pizza. All of it was fresh and very tasty! Also had brownie and ice cream, could be better. I suggest going for something else like tiramisu for dessert.Vegetarian options: Great veg pizzas, pastas and sandwiches and much more. Also great for people on diet as it offers protein bowls and healthy smoothies.",2
"Food is very nice but a little pricy
Overall loved the experience",2
"As soon as I entered the cafe I felt more than welcome. The cafe is bright with its well thought out decor. We had ordered stuff chicken breast with the side of veggies and mash potatoes and quinoa protein bowl. Since I am a vegan I took the server's recommendation for the dish as I wanted a meal, and it came out to be a perfect selection for my pallette.I enjoyed my meal along with Assam team and another drink we ordered was peach ice tea.The meal was heart warming and totally comforting.The tea was served separate with milk and sugar to be added to taste with two biscuits on the side.The quantity of the quinoa protein bowl was sufficient enough for me.The staff was extremely courteous. I bothered them with special request to place my phone on charge and they complied.On the whole and amazing experience. Would like to visit again soon.Spent 1000 per person.The washroom was neat.Vegetarian options: They have as many vegetarian options as non veg. They also have few vegan options .",2
The food here is absolutely amazing which matches up with the super cool ambience. The menu is on point. I wanted to try every dish on the menu. Definitely going back whenever I visit Chandigarh next. Highly recommended.,2
"My daily breakfast palace. Not to lie but If you have the right taste, the know your food taste. This is too good of a place not to have your breakfast and lunch dinner midnight idk any other place for this stuff. Too good! Comfy cozy.",2
"The food was average according to the price tag. Definitely could have been better. We had gone for breakfast. The bread slices with G.T.O. omlette were not properly toasted and upon requesting to get them toasted properly, the people there totally forgot to bring back the slices, and till then rest of my meal had completely gotten cold. The service though is polite.",1
"Same taste but different venue. New venture in sector 8 ,near gopals is like new atmosphere with same taste. We all know willow cafe, tantrums and backpackers are venture . But as far as food is concerned the quality is well maintained and it's upto mark. Salads were very nice.",2
I don't know why I found the place more pricey than expected.. People love you spend money for good food and atmosphere.. The interior is very photogenic.. But food was avg I found.. One boul of plain French fries with some meyo and few bacon on top is priced around 450/- however in the description vegetables were supposed to be added...  I hope some other dishes are not like this.. Will try some later.,2
"Sector 9, In the heart of city good, quality quick bites to have with family and friends. One most have white sources pasta from here no doubt all other items are also good like  chicken grilled garlic sandwich. Taste is very good .  All food items are very good. Staff is also very friendly. Very hygienic place parking space available for free. Ambiance is scenic. You can enjoy sitting here",2
"The experience at Backpackers Cafe in Chandigarh was decent, but there's room for improvement in the flavors of their dishes. The variety is there, but a more pronounced taste would enhance the overall dining experience.",2
"This place has a rusticly, vibrant vibe.. visited for the first time and we are site to return.. found the food really well cooked and kinda unique, while still being served real quick.. the servers are discreet but prompt..The teriyaki rice was excellentSo was the twist - of - a - sweet corn soup..",2
"Awesome food. Every time I visit Chandigarh, I come to their elante mall outlet. One may initially feel that the prices are steep but trust me they are value for money...the portion size is big and service is great. Special mention of Harinder our server past few months...",2
"Good place to have either coffee, all day breakfast, milkshakes and sandwiches. Nice staff and consistently good menu. Great option for laid back brunch or coffee with friends. The place is rather small so I don't recommend for groups larger than 4 people; ideal for two or three. Recommend the Helsinki, cold coffee and club sandwich.",2
"Everything was just perfect until I saw the waiter putting hand in his mouthü§£
But yes food was amazing! Soul fish üíØ/ üíØ",2
A great place to visit. Everyone should try Caramel baked cheese cake recommended by a friend and I loved it,2
"Some places and things live fondly in your brain and heart until you experience them. This has been my experience with Backpackers.I have now been in the tricity area for a few years. Everytime I saw the backpackers cafe, I would think about how cool it appears and that I should go there. After years of pushing it off, I finally did manage to visit one of them and boy was it disappointing. Ordered a pasta and a cold coffee, the pasta was pale and meh whilethe coffee... Well let's just say my 14 year old cousin makes a better coffee with his Nescafe instant mix.As always, giving them the benefit of funny l doubt, I will still try some other Backpackers someday. But for now, the myth of expecting something great there has been broken.",0
"Awesome cafe and great locations. Whenever I‚Äôm back home, it‚Äôs my default breakfast spot.But here‚Äôs some honest feedback on the F&B- Please take the shakshouka out of our menu. It‚Äôs beyond bad and not even remotely close to what the dish is supposed to be. The eggs are meant to be firm not dry but your chef in a whole new direction.- Find a new Barista and invest in someone who knows how to make coffee. Nespresso machines churn out a better cappuccino.Love the place, will be back but I hope you‚Äôll work on this feedback else you‚Äôll be competing with tier 2 and 3 eateries.",1
Have you been to a place where you feel like maybe instead of paying you are getting paid to eat ... That is the kind of service they provide.  It's an old place the ambience is really beautiful but they need to correct there service attitude a little... After all they are in service industry.,0
"We went to this Cafe for breakfast, even on a Sunday it was well occupied at 9 am, Cafe has more non vegetarian options but it doesn't disappoint vegetarians,we tried Stack of Pancakes and Indian Masala Omelette, helpings are neither too small nor too big,Cafe has great ambience,Worth trying",2
"Small cafe with a good vibe.
Food was good and service was also fine.
Good spot for Early breakfast.
The sandwich was really very good in taste.",2
The oven roasted sole is awesome! Good quality food. Great atmosphere,2
"Backpackers Cafe is amongst the best cafes in Chandigarh. It's a casual, high energy place. Their elaborate menu has something to soothe tastebuds of all age groups. Whether you are a native of the city or a traveller, this has to be on your must visit list.Parking: You can park right in front of the CafeKid-friendliness: Kids would enjoy hereWheelchair accessibility: Yes",2
"One of the highlights of the trip was the breakfast I had here.
Just a perfect start for your day!",2
"Amazing place!Most amazingly delivered food and courteous staff.Food will always taste the same no matter how many times u visit.Comfortable place.Must haves-Grill Chicken breast- serves with special sauce and saut√© veggies.Chicken cacciatore- served with thick gravy, garlic bread/rice and saut√© veggiesChicken Ceaser saladCaramel cheese cake- u ll not get it anywhere else.",2
"Unfortunately, there was a fly in the Backpacker's ointment, or should I say water. At 6 pm in the evening, a few flies decided to sample the hospitality of the cafe and chose the very table we were at. One even decided to take a dip in my glass of water after which it struggled out, dried its feathers (or wings) and buzzed off. When I pointed out the fly-by-night behaviour of the insouciant insect to the service personnel, he ""resolved"" the issue by simply removing the fly's bathtub- my glass.We're disappointed, especially because only a few days ago we had a nice experience in the Sector 8 Backpackers.",0
"Cozy, Warm and elegant cafe in the heart of Chandigarh.Relish your taste buds with the delectably delicious food of this cafe, Pizzas and pastas are amazing.Best time to visit would be for breakfast as rest of the day this cafe is almost packed.Polite and super attentive servers.10/10Parking: Parking space is more than enough.",2
"In love with interior of the cafe. Gives a feeling of cozy cafe in somewhere in small town. Those miniature of bikes, cars and italian decor makes you feel like a rider cafe.  Grilled Fish-A must try!",2
"First of all, I want these plates. So, Backpackers cafe people, please arrange this for me. üòâAnd second, there chicken club sandwich is a must try. Whenever I'm going anywhere outside the city, I call them and ask them to pack this sandwich for me and I eat this when in the car travelling.It's a good ambience place. It has books, great paintings, and a really good feeling.Maybe have breakfasts here.",2
"This place has been on my list of places to eat at. Finally, I went there and I must say the decor fits the name quite aptly. It's a casual place. Staff is cordial. Food is okay. I wasn't too hungry this time, so, I might have to go there again to try some of the other dishes. The menu is exactly same as the other place nearby called 'Tattlers'.",2
"Good service and ambience. Trendy crowd visits Backpackers.
However, the food taste is quite average.",1
Worst place i have ever visited. The coffee was so bad i mean you can make a good one at your home. Quiche was not tasty. Over rated place. Not worth the price.,0
"The main reason to visit Backpacker's cafe is the atmosphere. The food here is not bad but it is not very good either. It is quite average. If you want a chill evening in a nice cafe, this is a good option.",2
Nice cosy ambiance. I usually go for lunch with my friends and family. Staff is supportive. Food is yum. Quantity wise and quality wise. I like their cheese steak and risoto.. Good place to hangout.,2
"I ordered shakshuka and they gave me pathetic kadahi egg omlette with 2-3 days old bread .. Please first get the recipe how to cook it then mention it on your menu and also i ordered MOCHA, they provide milk with choclate syrup on it like seriously. Will never recommend this to anyone.",0
"Totally in awe of this place! Top notch food with cozy interiors. From sandwiches to coffee! They will never serve anything less than perfect! Courteous staff with crisp knowledge about what they are serving.
Veg/non-veg lasagne is a must must try!",2
The food is average for its popularity. Atleast the pizza and pasta that we had. The atmosphere and interiors are otherwise nice and the service is quite good.,1
"Best Place , Food is Too Good ‚ù§Ô∏è",2
"2 measly Chicken Frankfurters being passed as Bangers, served with 2 spoons of mash. Bangers are hearty pork sausages. So, please don't advertise wrongly on the menu.",0
"The best part of the Cafe is ample parking, good ambience and service. Food comes later.Ordered Spanish Omlette and it was made without potatoes. On asking, the server confirmed it to be the way THEY make it...ü§¶The toast was full crunchy, Ham sandwiches were tasty and ample. Coffee was reasonable.Still, it remains an oasis to get such food.",1
"Since its inception in 2007, Backpackers Cafe has  successfully carved a niche for itself in Chandigarh‚Äôs social circuit with its all-day breakfast menu. The travel artifacts and newspaper format menu along with a plethora of English breakfast dishes helped this cafe to break away from the clutter of ‚Äòdhabas‚Äô and pin itself on the backpacker‚Äôs map of travel cafes. Location: 16, Inner Market, Sector 9D, Near Chandigarh Dance Academy, Sector 9, East, Chandigarh Must Try: Caramel Cheese Cake Cost for two: Rs 1200/-",2
"This is our go to spot after cycle ride to the lake. It's pretty close and if you are lucky there is no waiting on the weekends when they open up. They also open at 8:30 in the morning which is earlier than most cafes.The breakfast menu caters to a global palette but is limited in what it offers. You would get eggs, granola bowls, smoothies etc. They also do coffee which tastes decent. The vibe is very casual, the staff are professional and courteous.",2
Food is good but they really need to level up their coffee game.,1
"Beautiful ambience
Though costly, but the quality and quantity of food is worth it.",2
Best place I visited in recent days. Food is great. Atmosphere is great.,2
The most brilliant place to have good food. Truly amazing food and service.,2
One of the best Caf√© in Chandigarh! Though bit expensive but yes worthy!,2
This places is highly underrated for the quality of the food it serves! It's slightly expensive but it definitely shows in the quality of the food. Very courteous and friendly staff.The place is very small with limited seating and it can get quite crowed during peak hours. Plan accordingly,2
"Backpackers cafe has one speciality that they have different menu at their branches in Chandigarh. This is something unique which is a different thing i ever noticed. But the nuggets were so tasty loaded with cheese üßÄ which has a different flavour.
Recommend üëç",2
"Amazing experience post a long run@ sukhna lake, its hardly 2 kms from sukhna lake, wonderful healthy yet simple and tasty breakfast!! Cool vibes",2
"AMAZING INTERIORS. Lovely quaint place. Food isn't too great, and it's too pricey. Just loved the interiors üòÇ",1
"I had a really delightful experience, this place offers the world's best Iced Caffe Latte! With an ambiance of a quaint little cafe,you'll definitely fall in love with this place.",2
Were sitting there for 30 mins and noone came to take the order. Very disappointed,0
"Not so fancy Place, I ordered  Chicken lasagne  with the sauce/curry. I've never seen lasagne served with bread and sauce..",2
Waiters a eager to serve. But the food look a lot of time to come. The place is quite small. We ordered berry smoothie which was good. And paneer burger which disappointing for the price. It hardly had any paneer and tasted average.,1
Had a classical club sandwich and chicken pepper steak. Sandwichü•™ was very good üëåüèºüëåüèº but steak sauce was a bit salty and saute vegetables were also soggy and salty although chicken was good. Rest service was good üòä and please make sitting    a bit more comfortable..,1
Toilets are absolutely filthy no toilet paper and staff just look doing nothing .I am overseas visitor was told about this place but very disappointed  in toilet even my dog can't get in there,0
"What a vibe. Does not feel like Chandigarh. The ambience, the crowd, the staff, the food quality - par excellent. Had Philadelphia sushi rolls and salmon pasta; quite delicious, fresh and service was super quick. The place is ultra clean, hygienic and the cafe has an overall freshness too.",2
Loved the atmosphere. Food and drinks were good as well.,2
All day veg and non veg menu.,2
"Service is strictly average, 25 minutes for pancakes at a non busy hour has no excuse.Water will only be served if you ask for it.And poached eggs are served boiled.Not worth it.",0
"Good place for breakfast, opens early",1
One of the best places in chandigarh for coffee . Apple pie is to die for,2
"It's excellent but, i think that the food is a little overpriced",2
"Healthy chef's special. Grilled chicken breast, Potato mash, Boiled veggies, toast served garlic sauce. Taste awesome..!!!!üòä",2
"Forgot one of the dishes for my order, after confirming twice. Other 4 dishes we order came one after the other, i would expect on a quite time should bring everything together..ordered a latte instead got the nescafe blend coffee powder mixed with warm milk..",1
Thank god this place exists. Coffeeshop nextdoor is also fine quality.,2
You know what to expect with this establishment. Very good always,2
"Awesome service, awesome food loved every moment",2
"The menu has a wide range of things to choose from, but I ordered a chicken cacciatore with a brown sauce. Everything looked good on the plate, but after having eaten a little portion of the meal, I found a black hair in my chicken, laden with the sauce. It was either from someone's beard or their head. I examined to make sure it wasn't mine or of the friend accompanying me.Our server, was very apologetic about the incident. He took the plate and asked if I'd like to order something else. His name was Eeshwar (I've forgotten the name, but I think it was this or something similar sounding) and I thank him for his reassurance and cooperation.However, if anything of this nature happens, the manager of the said place has always made sure to drop by the table and talk to me. Maybe it was the heavy foot-fall in the cafe then or simple unawareness of what's happened, for which reason the manager never came. So, it felt like this might be a routine occurance or that such matters are taken more than lightly, which is so upsetting.For a cafe with its reputation, I am not at all impressed with this lackadaisacal and negligent attitude towards service, or the hair served to me on a platter, literally.My appitite was ruined and I couldn't wait to run oun out and get a meal ANYWHERE else.",0
Food is qualtitative and Quantity is more than expectations. Ambience is too attractive,2
"Casual, busy place.
Excellent omlette. Lovely coffee.",2
"Nothing much to talk about food here .Very very in fact very average  food .Pizza was not wood fired ,just regular grilled -such a dab considering we get super pizzas at otherplaces in Chandigarh .Chicken wings were just all spiceLamb skillet was pieces of lamb in a pyaaz tamatar gravy like we make at home just before we put the water for curry üò≥Bruschetta was drab minced meat on bread -üëéAvoid for foodAmbience is goodJust sit there  and don't eat",0
Meals at extra cost but nothing special. They gave Banana coffee shake for almost ‚Çπ400 but you can make it better at your own house. Only french fries were good (one extra star for that).,0
"Know this place for 11 years now, they have a menu every taste bud will find something, they pick up trends and interpret them well, tasty, good quality, great coffee (from me a compliment), you sure don't go home hungry. Have been awarded for their food by times of india for years in a row now and well deserved",2
"Absolutely great menu, staff and food!",2
"Bit expensive, ordered a French Toast which was Rs.475 which had 3 slices of bread which is exorbitantly high. Else Baguette, pancakes which we ordered was really nice.",2
The food is fresh but it lack flavours,2
Absolutely amazing food and good vibes.,2
"All time favourite. I'm not from Chandigarh but every time I'm there, this is a must go place for me. They never go wrong with their food and service. If I'm ever looking for a place to go eat, I know that this one will never disappoint. I'm always excited to go here and really wish the team all the best for future. Keep it up!",2
"Ate there on 14th June and my daughter and I went down with severe food poisoning. We already weren't happy about the food served to us , not tasty , coffee was made by someone who didn't know how to make a simple cappuccino , pineapple carrot juice tasted as thought it was taken out hours before. All in all a terrible experience. Won't recommend. Btw this is the second time i got food poisoning eating here in the past six months.One star for location",0
Good quality food with good menu,2
"Cozy, warm with quirky interior design.
Chocolate souffle was unexpectedly very tasty.",2
"Good vibes but get some beers on the menu, no alcohol is a deterrent",2
"The cafe has excellent ambience and is located at prime place. Their service was excellent as well and they politely accepted our special requests. However, the food lacked the taste I expected. Fries were not juicy enough and the sandwich was pretty plain. Maybe it was the food I ordered but it didn‚Äôt meet my expectations.",0
We were shocked at the state of the food. The ambience is quite nice but you need to have a certain skill to ruin something as simple as a pizza. Overpriced. The food wasn't at par with the cost. Disappointing experience.,0
This is a great place to dine. The space has a chic vibe and energy. The food is excellent and prepared fresh. The menu has something for everyone.,2
I really love everything about this restaurant .,2
"Decent place, although there wasn't anything backpacking-specific about it",2
"ordered shakshuka and vietnames bahn mi sandwich. who makes shakshuka with okra ( bhindi) and serves bahn mi with mayo ? the chef needs to learn what shaksuka , bahn mi is before putting on menu. upgraded to 2 stars from 1 stars as my son enjoyed his pancakes and chicken tikka sandwich",0
"Visited this place couple of weeks back with Friends :Review :1. Ordered Pancakes : Did taste good2. Cold Coffee : Did taste goodBut worst experience happened with Pizza :Did order a pizza and waited for around 15-20 mins and eventually when it arrived, there were hair in it.Then they took it back and took another 20 mins to bring a new one.By that time were not even that hungry as we were when we ordered.So this kind of ruined my experience.Ambiance :1. Place is good with some good outlook with interior but all you see most of time is parking outside so that was an odd experience for a place like this.",0
"Baker's Lounge serves an exquisite Blueberry Cheesecake that is truly a culinary masterpiece. The velvety smooth texture of the cheesecake perfectly complements the burst of fresh blueberries, creating a harmonious symphony of flavors. The crust is impeccably baked, providing a delightful contrast to the creamy filling. Each bite is a journey through layers of indulgence, leaving you craving for more. This Blueberry Cheesecake at Baker's Lounge is a heavenly treat that encapsulates the essence of a delectable dessert experience.",2
"Such a poor service, rude staff, extremely over hyped only. Even owner couple is such a egoistic.
Dont ever go there for any kind of bday parties. After giving money even pathetic service and such pathetic service and really idiot staff",0
"Baker's Lounge offers top-notch cakes at unbeatable prices, surprising me with both the quality and affordability of their delicious treats.",2
"I had ordered cake on 7th November to make delivery on 8th November evening,  they promised to keep it ready at 10am on 8th November but worst was at waiting as when I reached to take the delivery of cake at 6.20pm on 8th they were looking blank and behaving as surprised. They had not prepared the cake and spoiled my daughter's birthday get-together.   Absolutely frustrating and pathetic services. Not a trust worthy Bakers. Won't recommend anyone to purchase.",0
"Pathetic food quality. Attended a birthday party on 4th November. More than 10 people have fallen SICK post that. The service was bad too.Also, in case you order a cake and it does not turn out the same as ordered, the lady(owner ) will never agree. She will argue and give you all the silly reasons . Horrible behaviour and services.",0
"They fat shamed a 10 year old child. A pre informed birthday celebration of my kid where we told in advance that we will be using play area for the kids. The area in charge let all the kids get in to the play area except 1 girl child, obnoxiously telling in front of her that she cant be allowed inside because of their height & weight. Hoping that he is not sensible enough to understand the seriousness of this, I talked with the owner. Surprisingly, he also sang the same song, without even looking at the girl. There was no information in any form shared with us or displayed on the premises about the limit of height or weight that cant be allowed.  The decision is entirely of the owner, who arbitrarily, allowed the same girl to play in the area 2 months ago. Let aside the level of realizing customer satisfaction,  they were rude enough to made a girl feel low in front of her classmates. Nevertheless, the solution was provided by the kids who decided to play hide & seek so the that beautiful girl can also play. My message to Baker's Longue : An outlet, who apparently serves high calories products that are definitely going to increase body fat, should at least consider not calling their customers fat , not at least a child.",0
"Very poor services. We buy a cake for our MD, we want with a pic and that send it as it is normal.
Even taking the total amount in advance.",0
"Absolutely loved their bakery and gift collection.
I hv become a new fan. Most recommended.",2
Aaj 16 Dec 2023 ko pastries pack karvayi....or ye plastic ka sharp piece  aaya.... Please focus on quality üôè,0
Purchased dry cake after reaching home when all family members saw all said these r too big then we called shop for replacement then they said that we can not replace this is nt the way of working,0
Good for bakery stuff & hot beverages. Don't expect much from other dishes on the list.,2
"Worst food experience, worst service. Serviced stale pizza and on complaining for same , refused to exchange and also charged money for same even though we have not eaten same.Owners reaction also not acceptable as on informing about staff behaviour they haven't bothered muchWon't recommend to anyone as may spoil your evening üëéüëé",0
Pizza quality very bad,0
Bakery having all pure veg items... They are professionals in making cakes of any kind you just need share  the picture or describe what u need. They also have variety of snacks and also have a hall for small parties. I have been here many times and no complaints.,2
"Presentation is good. But the taste is not good as per the price.
Hope they work on the taste. The burger size is big and you can't eat with hands they don't even provide any knife or anything to cut unless it is being asked.",1
These fraudsters are pushing stale Cake. And if you wanna to give a feed back these ignorant people just don't wanna listen.Today  evening my sister bought a pineapple cake  from these Cheaters.  When we at every one in home stated it's stale not fresh.  I called them the guy on phone we rude to me ! So i took the remaining cake and went to the shop.and asked for the person who attended the call . When I was talking to that guy the owner's son jumped into the conversation and  made a statement that you have bought this cake yesterday! Shame on him without knowing that fact made a loose statement . Then her mother came into the conversation stating we will refund the amount. Which I refused as it's not about money. It is all about how you see customer or treat customer. Shameful and ignorant people.  Keep that attitude and surly u will feel the heat soon than you even think of.  Again don't sell stale food. U loose customer and name which took so many years to build. By offering refund is not a solution. Simple solution would have been u people sincerely admit and say it would happen again' and try to improve in future.,0
"Personal touch is missing. We stopped shopping our breads here about 5 years ago. Recently I was there with my family to attend a birthday party and found that nothing has improved, focus is on the money only and not on clients and guests. It's a place where they are only focused to make money and no quality of service and hygiene. There is no hospitality. I won't recommend this place.",1
"absolutely TRASHY Garlic Toasts.
Completely drenched in oil.
could perhaps use them as toasties in a tomato soup than a snack.",0
Its name tag is for bakery products but supples all sort  of confectionery  and snacks. Shops gives a crowded look,1
All bekary items are available at a reasonable price very good experience,2
Bakers lounge is good place to get bakery items..But now there prices are sky high. They are selling cakes at 40% higher prices thn two years before.Please someone tell them they are not the only one here. ü§£ü§£,1
"Pathetic Service.. Rude, Arrogent and Cheaters... Food Quality is very poor and kids playing area is also messy and dirty.",0
Worst experience...i celebrated my daughter's birthday at there place and the way they made extra money from me was not less than a fraud...they manipulated everything and the dealing person was not good at all...also they gave me wrong flavoured cake of worth Rs 4300/- and when i complained to the dealing person with pics of cake after 2-3 replies he started ignoring my messages and call...i also mailed 2-3 times to the owner by mentioning all the harrasment caused to me on a special day of my daughter but till date i haven't received any reply or any kind of solution from their end for the mistake they have done..... their atitude is not to give good customer service or to make their customers satisfied by accepting their mistakes they only know how to make money by befooling the customers... A big NO to baker's lounge now...,0
"Ambience is nice and the service is good. Staff is cooperative and friendly. Cozy appealing vibes on th first floor seating area. However, not a big fan of the food here esp Croissant.
Baaki definitely a chill place.",2
Food's good.. proper restaurant on the first floor and bakery items and sweet shop on the ground floor. Price is bit high but when you get tasty food it doesn't matter.,2
Amazing range of Cakes and other bakery items. I have been a regular customer to this store since last 4-5 years and they have maintained their quality of products throughout. Pricing on a slight higher side but still don't hurt citing the quality and taste of each item.,2
Amazing job place to have desserts and north India food! The food is reasonably priced and tastes amazing! Their cakes are delicious and very pretty! Definitely worth the visit,2
"Good variety. Great ambience. Nice taste.
Tostie- Quantity: 3.5/5, Quality: 3/5, Price: 3/5, Taste: 2.5/5
Sacher brownie pastry- Quantity: 4/5, Quality: 4/5, Price: 3/5, Taste: 4/5
Pineapple pastry- Quantity: 4/5, Quality: 4/5, Price: 4/5, Taste: 4.5/5",2
"Poor quality bakery. Earlier it was good but now they have reduced their cake and biscuits quality. Adding up to my surprise, My grandson showed me hair in their biscuits. Sad state of baking.",0
"The food is very delicious and pocket friendly budget. The service is excellent and the people are very warm and helpful. Should definitely go for a good meal and to spend time with family and friends.
The beautiful ambience is a star of the entire visit.",2
"Service has gone from bad to worse. The owners have earned a lot and have started to think that they are above customers. They should remember that they are living a lavish life because of high profit margins, income tax evasion and because we are paying them. Please keep this in mind next time you collect your livelihood from your customers.",0
"Pathetic.The service is in very sorry state.Visited their outlet and ordered for a cake a day before my son's birthday. They charged me in full and delivered the cake late by 2 hours . Cake was supposed to be delivered by 5-5:30 pm but the guy showed up around 7:30.I called them at 6, 6:30, 7.. every time they kept on telling me that it will reach in few minutes.I have experienced this issue for the second time in 2 years.The approach is very lala type and sorry to say that this kind of attitude will only bring their reputation and business down.",0
"Oh, it's not good at all. This happens when one has too much on his plate. It was good till it was just a bakery. Now, it is a multi-junction food point, and everything has become below par. I recently had a very bad experience with them. Hope they sort themselves out sooner.",0
"The sell good cake but warning, carry ur won plates...they charge you 1100 rs for a small cake and give u 1 wooden knife and 2 candles. Rest all including paper plates is chargeable.",0
The staff doesn‚Äôt know at all how to speak to the customers. I just took my pet in because i had to buy a cake for my frnd‚Äôs birthday . My pet cat is fully vaccinated and goes everywhere welcomed by everyone. They were very rude to me even when i told them i took him in because i couldn‚Äôt left him alone in the car. It was very disrespectful and the staff was very uncomforting.,0
"Have been a regular at this place for years.. now it has become a restaurant and a kid's playing place as well. Have eaten at the restaurant couple of times and the food was nice but i think the food quality has deteriorated now. Went for a dinner yesterday and each and every dish was not upto the mark.  The soup, the dosa, the paneer dish everything was not even close to being tasty.",0
"Ok kinds.Staff not customer centric (not the focus area probably). Products too average.I strongly feel, it flows from the top.Fortunate owners that the venture clicked for them.",1
"Ordered a cake 2 days back, on the day of delivery they kept telling me its on the way‚Ä¶we r getting it ready, i gave thm time 12 noon, after repeated calls they asked me at 2 pm , mam apne kaunsa cake order kia tha. Spoiled my mother‚Äôs bdy. All of my guests had gone till then.  Worst experience, whts a bdy party without a cake. Never going there again.",0
Bad place staff rudely behaviour to the guest price was very high,0
I went there and didn't got plates after  packing of 45 samosa and as we also bought 3kg dhokla and jalabi but they said we only can give plates as complementary which were 15 in number more than complementary they will charge 1rs for 1plate and 1 rs for spoon,2
"They are one of the best Bakery in Panchkula. Their breads, cookies and cake are fresh and delicious. One can also try its restaurant menu. However, I have personally never eaten from their",2
Extremely sorry for your pineapple cake which was loaded with so called pineapples and without pineapple cake taste. It was just almonds around nd you told me to cut outer layer of almonds for taste. That was just not your quality.,0
"Twice daily fresh supply of bakery. Great variety of cakes,bakes & breads ,buns. Costing is reasonable too. I'm only concerned of the extra sugar on most products ,this needs to cut down and a sugar free corner of items ,would be welcome here. Is anybody listening.",2
I wanted to get a Peppa pig themed cake for my little one's birthday and I must say that Baker's Lounge did an amazing job. I was wondering what flavor would be good and the lady at Baker's Lounge suggested a few of them and I decided to go with Coffee Caramel Flavor. I was extremely happy with the flavor and they made the cake exactly the way I wanted. My guests and all kids enjoyed the cake a lot and my Little one was super happy with the cake too. Definitely recommend this place. Thank you so much for your wonderful cake and to see my kid happy was like a cherry on top.,2
"Used to have good quality cakes but not anymore. Cakes are too dry and not edible. The ""Happy Birthday / anniversary"" message, knife etc they put on the cake is the cheap red plastic ones despite the place and prices being premium.The place is perpetually under-construction. Move carefully as electricity wires are all over the floor and dropping from the ceilings. I visited 4 times in last 2 months. Person on the counter is always eating and talking rudely to the employees which gives a bad impression.It was one of the places in Panchkula where we used to enjoy good coffee and snacks but not going there again now.",0
"One of the worst and unprofessional service . Ordered a Cake for kid birthday (two days prior to event ). When I reached for delivery , name of kid was wrong. When I informed them , they told that they will correct it in ten minutes . Waited for 40 minutes and when enquired again , counter guy told me that I can take my money back !!!! So by giving money he washed his hands from all of his responsibility . So don‚Äôt trust them for these things .",0
one of the worst place i have ever been they dont even know how to talk to customers.  they wasted my 2 hrs on the order of a cake  . the owner is soo arrogant  and worst staff. would not recommend this place to anyone now,0
"My go to place for buying cakes of all sorts and cookies! Their chocochip dry cake is the best!! Always a treat going during festive seasons!
They have other varieties of bakery items too, must visit!",2
Worst food ever. No professionalism. Stale cake and dishes. Charged more and on discussing the owner started shouting. Rude and unprofessional in all ways. Opened the shop basically to loot people. Communicated to charge something for the party and in the end levied extra charges for all things. She basically needs money for even entering her premises. Please don't waste your money here. It is the worst place for food. If you want to have a wonderful party please have it anywhere apart from this place. A roadside stall guy must be treating customers better than her. A thief in disguise of a shop owner.,0
Love the place whenever I buy any cake from here. Lot of flavors to choose from. I have been getting customize cakes from them and the final cake preparation is always amazing. The prices are high but then so is the quality as well . You get several snacks as well at the place. Overall a great spot.,2
"One of the best bakery shops in the town. Most of things they bake themselves and are at affordable prices. Every time I have purchased from them, things have been fresh. So I will highly recommend everyone bakker's lounge for their bakery needs.",2
Never ever go to this shop if you have bit of self respect! Lady owner‚Äôs attitude is unbearable.. never saw anyone who‚Äôs running a business with this much attitude! Full of arrogance ego and can‚Äôt withstand any kind of feedbacks. Other reviews are a proof! People until we stop supporting such people they‚Äôre never gonna change so think before buying from them next time!!,0
"Great food, great environment, great price, one of a kind place for a cup of brew or a cake, or a pizza roll, or whatever a hell you're into that a bakery offers. It's an up and coming chain in Chandigarh, and is definitely worth a visit. Even the owner is ever so friendly and affable.",2
"Very bad service in restaurant, wait too much after given order.",0
One of the best bakers in town offering eggless cakes. Also offers dedicated space for children to have fun!!,2
"This totally recommended place is a commingle of many ventures under one roof. Pat on the back for being pure vegetarian and having family-style environment.The ground floor offers bakery items, handheld foods, cakes, chocolates and alot more under the name- Baker's lounge. Along with this, they manage well to sell out pre-packed cookies, assorted nuts and other hampers. They can customize according to your requirements and budget. Some of the preparations and products are surely worth a try.Must try- Frosted cakes, assorted chocolates and brownies.Recommended!!Cost for 2- Rupees 250 approx.Follow @Iconnectwithfood on IG",2
"Overrated bakery . My food wasn't fresh .I posted 2 star and this review 3 years back and again shiftinhg it to 1 star.How can you spoil some ones special day!You showed us a 3 layered cake for 4kgs while booking and delivered 2 layered cake , we couldn't even serve all our guests.And shame on you for not accepting your fault.Guys beware of this brand. They are cheaters and unprofessionals.",0
"I bought a loaf of bread however  the quality  has deteriorated, it is no more than a y other  normal bread. By mixing  Bakery a nd sweets together  the uniqueness of the  shop has vanished.",0
"Loved my overall experience. Very delicious food, quality and quantity both are too good. Love the vibe of place. Must recommend for family and friends dinners or lunches.. They also have  kids section which is mind blowing",2
Provide various bakery products. Quality of food is really good and tastes good but pricing is a little on the higher side. Ambiance of the place is really good along with the service. All in all a good place but they can do better in the pricing department.(Tip : If you are thinking about ordering cake from here on New Year's eve then either place you order early through a phone call or plan an early takeaway. Otherwise be prepared to buy cake in a shop full of a mob. Personal Experience),2
Good place but need more variety.,2
"Wow! What a place for bakery products, must visit.You guys should hire a good writer, or a writer with good writing skills. Check the Cake with Chocolate Base, and the one with white base.A lot of difference.Please take a note",1
"I purchased a red velvet cake for a house party from Baker's Lounge last week, but I have to say, the quality of their products has really dropped too much... While 2 or 3 years ago, when it was a new shop, they had the BEST cakes and pastries! But now the quality has only gone downhill, and I was left throughly disappointed by this cake. It only looks good in the photo, but actually it was so dry! It was also not sweet enough! I am never ordering a cake from this place again!! The only reason I'm even writing this review is because their choco-chip cookies have remained good after all (though not as good or as big as before).They have really cut corners with the quality of the products... hopefully they will raise their standards again, otherwise this place has not stood the test of time... It has only become more expensive, as the food goes from bad to worse. Will not recommend AT ALL.Try Baker's Over, it is a better shop with soft and good cakes. Baker's Lounge is nit good these days (2018)",0
"Wow! What a place for bakery products and other stuff like cakes, snacks. You must visit this place if you haven't yet.Even the decor is good.One of the best bakery shops in panchkula, no doubt in that..They also have kids section which is just amazing.Highly recommended guys..",2
This is regarding their restaurant THE PLATFORM.  THE RATES AT MENU ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT ARE SHOWN ON ZOMATO AND SWIGGY SITES. THE MENU RATES ARE MUCH HIGHER AND BILLING IS BEING DINE BY MENU RATES. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE,2
"This is a great place to pick up breads etc for your home. They don‚Äôt have much of place to sit. They do have good collection of pastries and cakes. However, I didn‚Äôt find them exceptional. Over all a not so good and not so bad place to go to.",1
"I ordered my daughter's birthday cake, though the cake was delicious, thry spoiled her birthday party as I had booked cake few days in advance and on the day, they didn't deliver at promised time, i had to follow up multiple times to get it delivered and about 100 people party was waiting on the cake an hour and 15 mins late. Embarrassing for me and frustrating. And top of that the guy who delivered wasn't even aware that he was delivering it late.",0
"My all time favourite for bakery and golgappas. They prepare all vegetarian and bake most delicious cakes.
Must try.",2
Variety of cakes are available here.Quality is also awesome.There is space available to celebrate kids party .,2
Place to get a fresh bakery items. The cakes you get here are yum!! Chocolate praline cake never lets you down... It's awesome and you should definitely try it you are fond of cakes,2
"Good place for cakes, breads and biscuits. Go there regularly. They need to clearly mark the fruit cakes and walnut cakes as vegetarian/eggless or not. No red or green dots on any of those items. So it is a bit confusing. I had got a 'with eggs' banana cake once by mistake. Told the owners about it. But no response. Nor did they rectify it.",2
"I bought a cake from here and they gave me cake in very bad condition, yesterday was my reception party and when I asked for solution they were very rude, they don't know how to talk with customer, it's very unprofessional, I do not recommend buying them themed cakes.",0
Good Cakes. Nice place to get cookies n namkeen n juice hampers. Chocolate varieties are less. Billing is slow. Quite crowded in evenings.,2
"Worst catering exp. Caterers reached the venue after the party got started . They reached 3-4 hours late from the scheduled time . After reaching late , they were not ready to serve the guests. Waiters were not serving properly. In the main dinner menu, lot of stalls were missing.lot of mismanagement was there at the part of the caterer.",0
"One of my favourite bakeries in Panchkula. Tryst with Baker‚Äôs lounge started through cakes, panninis and cold coffee but soon it became an obsession. The food they serve is fresh, rich in flavours and quite nicely presented as well. Earlier it use to be just a few eatables but now it‚Äôs like a heaven for the bakery lovers. On top that, they have a courteous staff as well. I‚Äôd recommend you to try them out and my favourite cold coffee as well.",2
"Arrogance of owners,  pathetic food quality, lack ot basic etiquettes, over pricing are some of the traits of this bakery. They have third party bakers based in chandigarh industrial area where products are available for retail / wholesale are much lower prices and they make humongous margins especially on cakes and other products.",0
Highly recommend they make very good cakes. I ordered for my sons first birthday the cake was exactly the same as shown to me. Keep on making people laugh smile and love ur cakes.,2
Worst experience. Their cakes are stale and smelly. Inspite of having a good name I don't find their cakes as well as their behaviour towards customers very satisfying. These people are sitting in the shop just for making money and doesn't give a damn about customer's health. Bought a fruit cake from them but it was so bad that i personally went back to return it. Wastage of money and time.,0
"Just the Cakes and that is it.They make Good eggless Cakes and nothing else i really ever liked. Used to have a decent pasta once upon a time.  But they stopped making that. Renovation was going on for a bit and now it's turning into a multi purpose showroom. A party place, a cafe i guess.",1
Very pathetic services ..on father's day I have ordered fruit cup cakes and they have charged for the same but when I went for pickup they said cup cakes has been sold out and we will again make but when I ate that was chocolate cup cakes ..they are charging high but not delivering the product according. Very very bad experience..never visit panchkula store again.,0
Very well maintained from inside. But they also need to take note of their surroundings. Golgappe serving place is horrible.,1
"Great dry cake and some cookies are really nice.Breads and pizza bases are wonderful too.Safety wise,  only a sanitizer at the gate, and packed food. The person at the cash doesn't wear a mask for some reason.",2
"Good one but little expensive.. like if you get cookies on other shop 50 rs there you get same cookies 90-120 in their own packing.
But overall you will get variety there.",2
Good place for cakes and bakery products..,2
Nice restaurant on first floor  on Railway theme. Named Platform.  Nice ambience and good food. Only veg. Give it a try.,2
"They have exquisite variety in cakes, pasteries and cookies. Must stop shop for all passer by who are looking out for sweet delights. The desserts are good in taste. Quality of the stuff is Good. Staff is nicely trained.",2
The cakes were good decade back. Now the quality is declining and the attitude of the owner has incresed. They dont even listen to your complaints. The cakes are also old . And the quotation they put for cakes vary. The place is not at all recommended.,0
We ordered cake for my sister's birthday.üéà But I didn't get to taste it   because I was busy attending the guests!! But it looks superb so I think the taste was also great.üòÇ,2
"Had birthday party in there play area soo chaotic it was... ac was not working the helping ladies were soo lazy, power cut more than 20 times and i was all black kids were soo scared because of it. Other party kids were also in that play area any outside kid can also join. Approx 40 kids were their in that small play area.  cake was just okaish.. the quality has gone down.. Need to improve on it. Wont recommend for play area. Party at your own risk.",0
"Today after so much of bad experiences buying  products from it, I am writing this review. Baker's lounge cake  quality has gone down. Moreover , the food snacks like burger and hotdog are so horrible that I may not eat it for free also now. Both the things just contain too much of bread, no taste and the rates are not less that one could compromise on taste and quality.",0
"This was a very nice place for cakes but from the day when they have started their sweets work cakes are having a very low quality and very unhygienic
Pastry‚Äôs are really dry and not fresh
Not recommend",0
One of the worst bakery in tricity.just few days ago I have ordered a cake for my daughter birthday.they have charged full for the delivery.but on the birthday date they have not delivered the cake.we are waiting for them 2hrs and didn't delivered.after waiting my husband went to the shop and when he raised the issue staff has started misbehave with him.even the owner didn't take the pain.i will never visit this bakery again in my life.,0
"The new menu and delivery options used to be pretty good. Sadly, my kaju katli box contained a very sad khajur barfi...so dunno if this is a genuine or festival special organized trick. Would be wary of ordering prepacked mithai",0
Service is use less I ask your representative to provide me a spoon they ask we have only fouk if you need take it other wise no need image as a proof,0
"Very Tasty Food. It's a good place for ordering cakes, pastries, desserts. You can dine in or order as well. We order Birthday cakes regularly from This place. We have placed a big order fir a wedding also . Till now they have not disappointed, hope will not disappoint now.",2
"The chese puffs  we bought are soggy n tasteless .
Standard has diluted so badly .
Cakes are not palatable .
Price very high for the standard they offer",0
Worst ever cake got for my sons birthday celebration. Pathetic aesthetic sense. Even the local market guy would have delivered better cake. My last order from them. Sorry to say but it‚Äôs true !!!,0
Pathetic service... The Owner pooja is very rude has got no sense to deal with the problem.. For them customer complaint is nothing.. My child was not comfortable to play with there staff so instead of refunding us she started making stories and agreed to half the payment but soon after that she demanded we can only adjust your amount if you use our restraunt... She has no value for her words.,0
Purchased Fruit Cake for my son's birthday party. Kids not enjoyed cake astaste of cake was not good and it was completely wastage of money....Returned cake to shopkeeper and explained about compromised quality....Not expected this type of pathetic quality from bakers lounge....,0
Very bad experience nothing is fresh in bakery items and restaurant food taste not so good,0
Good place to visit for cakes and other bakery items.......Cakes - The fillings and base of cakes are fresh and of good quality......for pineapple cake the real fruit was used istead of flavours......that is something that I look into a cake.......few cakes have sugar syrup hence they are over sweetened....these cakes are not of good taste even if you love the sweetsDonuts - I tried donuts from this place and the taste was pathetic.......for donuts the one and only recommendation is Dunkin DonutsRest pastries and other items are good......,2
The best place for cakes n stuff ... it's been 5 consecutive years since we have been ordering cakes for my Son's birthday from them ... and what they make always keeps us stunned and extremely happy .. the cake is always what everyone waits for every time on My lil one's birthday as its always truly awesome and yummy ... Highly recommended !! Thanks guys !! keep the good work on ...,2
"Amazing cake made on order. Got my father's retirement cake custom made for here. They also make sugar-free cakes and have good selection of breads, cookies etc.",2
"All products are unhealthy. Breads are stale. They dnt hv expiry dates on bread. Sugar free is high on Sugar, donot buy it as harmful for diabetics. Birthday Cakes are not made as they promise. They started with good products but now they are not concerned about quality & health. But their business. Rennovation may attract new customers but as we were regular customer s , now have decided to completely stop consuming any product of bakers lounge. We found a new bakery in the next block English Bakery with much better customised cakes. Bakers lounge need to seriously work on their baked items to live up to their claims.",0
"It's not a bakers lounge basically, the real name is Brinda, staff is totally unprofessional, refused delivery , finishing of product is not as good as bakers oven panchkula or zirakpur",0
"An awesome place to go with family, friends. Had birthday party there!  Everything was fantastic i.e service, food, interior & cake...  Very polite & good staff...Thanks for making our day special",2
Horrible experince on 21 dec. 2020. Arrogant and uptightbowner lady at counter. Shop was empty. Was made to go around 5 times to different counters to sleep and pay and collectvitw... in a shop where's there were not other customers?Even though I reported this to the owner she was indifferent. Refused to acknowledge and pull up her staff.I have been buying from them for 20 years depitse their exorbitant prices... no more...,0
"It's just a 'hatti'. For those of you who don't know punjabi, please google it. Poor quality products. Pretentious place. And the guy at the cash counter discourages card payments. No card works on his machine!",0
Not happy with the practices there.Ordered Ice Tea ...was surprised to see the quantity.It was served in a thin tall glass filled with ice cube....quantity of ice tea was hardly 100 ml and they charged 90rs for that :-(I regret going there nowadays....Cleanliness is an issue and the staff has a very casual approach towards everything.,0
The Bakery is located in the centre of the city. The preparation is always found fresh and delicious one. Every type of Bakery items are available here. You have not to go here n there. Moreover the behaviour of the staff is cooperative and remarkable.,2
This is quite the brunch. They have three levels you can do depending on if you just want mock tails till you want a bottle of champagne! There is so much seafood to eat. I‚Äôve probably had at least five different types of shrimp prepared different ways. The sushi is very very fresh and is very creative. The Indian food is also very fresh. The only thing I was disappointed by was the dim sum!  My waiter Rahul took very good care of me!,2
Went for a lunch buffet.Grill counter was amazing. Loved the prawns and fish.Desserts bar is tempting too.Main course was decent.A bit heavy on the pocket. Make sure you save your appetite for this to make ths most of buffet.,2
"The food was good but somehow I was not happy with the seafood item. They were a bit too over cooked or over spiced. The buffet option were nice but not outstanding. However it has a lovely ambience, lighting and environment.",2
"First things first, we stayed at the hotel and the lunch at Tamara was included as part of the package. Did have issues with the hotel and restaurant staff regarding weather we would be allowed in üòÇ coZ they didn‚Äôt realize Sunday don‚Äôt have Lunch but Brunch, but after a few calls it was sorted.Now the food and service in the restaurant: the food was good and service was definitely great.There could be more options on the table but whatever they had was still great!!",2
"After lot of research we zeroed into this place and let me tell you what an amazing place it was. Beautiful hotel. Fabulous restaurant. Dynamic, helpful, co operative staff. Oodles of options to eat from. Taste beyond imagination. Every possible cuisine of the world was there in our lunch buffet. Each and every penny worth! Mr Ravish, Ms Mary were more than amazing. In fact we din realise that we went there for the first time.. The extremely warm hospitality makes it a Highly recommended place. Will visit Tamra again for eating all the food options that we could not taste today. üòÜAbsolutely 5 star experience. 10 on 10..and yeah to summarize, my one liner would be.. The best place in Delhi for dining.. Keep it up.",2
"Tamra is a restaurant that likely specializes in Indian cuisine. It is likely named after the Sanskrit word ""Tamra"" which means copper. Copper has cultural and traditional significance in Indian culture and is often used in cookware and serving dishes. Depending on the location, Tamra restaurant may offer a range of traditional Indian dishes, such as tandoori chicken, curries, biryanis, and more. The specific offerings and atmosphere of Tamra restaurant.It is located in cp new delhi.U will enjoy its environment.Don't forget to test paradise drink here...",2
"One of the most authentic and best restaurant I have ever visited. Tamra has it all! Truly they have maintained the standards, international cuisines and complete hygeine. The interiors are really nice! Tamra is a perfect place for dinner date and they offer wide range of food to choose from as it is a buffet system. We literally tried each and every dish offered at Tamra's dinner buffet and our experience was best till yet. Worth every penny! I'm gonna visit this place again and again. Big cheers to Tamra's chefs and entitre team.",2
"Awesome Buffet.ü•Çü•Çü•Çüëçüëçüëçüçªüçªüçª‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖOne of the largest Expanse and variety of Food and Cuisines fromJapanese Sushi to Indian Street Food.Some food was amazingly tasty, some average to good though.Overall good though, no complaints there.Services were good, unless went the restaurant got too full, for a slight period everyone was too busy, and difficult to hold by, though for short.Place and Ambience is also very very good.Special Thanks to people who helped service our do, too well.Ron, Vikas, Neerajüëåüëåüëå",2
"One of the highly rated (Zomato) & recommended buffet fine dining option in Central Delhi.This restaurant has it all; comfortable seating, view of the grand central Delhi streets, polite staff & expansive spread of dishes.Went there with my mom and brother. All three of us came out happy & satisfied with the experience.Pros:#Every dish we tasted had it's own identity in terms of taste and originality.#Chicken &  mutton dishes were soft & amazingly well cooked#Desert section had Indian sweets, pastries, pie & ice cream. Something for everyone.Special mention to perfectly baked Indian breads. üòãCons:#The food spread had pretty good variety if not the best. However, the major let down was no mocktail/juice option included in the buffet (though could be ordered separately)#variety in starters has some scope for improvement.Best dishes from the buffet: Minced basil Chicked, fruit tart, hummus, berry piePricing: Around 3600/- (including taxes for weekday lunch buffet)",2
"Tamara - as the name suggests, it's pure class. If you want to pamper yourself without caring about being bit lavish, this is the place to be .Amazing food variety and quality of food.Plus the Ambience and staff is a big thumbs upüëçüèª",2
"Exquisite food with a lot of options to eat from. They had almost all types of cuisines including Chinese , Indian , European, Thai etc.From Hyderabadi biryani to Sushi, from lamb to pork they had everything and the view is majestic. Definitely worth going again.They charge 2800/- plus tax for Buffett lunch, a la carte option is also available but Buffett is recommended. The taste of everything was up to the mark and the e hospitality was great as well. Good work Shangri-La!",2
"If you are going from dinner buffet, do try tea after your meals, its mind blowing. Overall great experience, you won't be disappointed  if you are spending good amount of money, you will get that luxurious feel and treatment. Great for family or couple. Multi cuisine makes it fresh and new every time you go. Staff is courteous and chefs are great. Keep some space in tummy for mind blowing cakes of theirs in the end.",2
Best date place in Delhi..we had buffet in tamra bit expensive but worth it... service was quick and staff was really helpful and good...staff was very much welcoming each and every guest..Buffet spread was very nice and quality of food was taken care very nicely but I felt no chicken staters were available in buffet I felt that missing rest everything was really nice and tasty...host service staff and chefs everyone was helpful even when the restaurant was really busy...keep up the team...you guys are doing great üëç,2
We recently have had a team lunch in Tamra at Shangri-La in New Delhi. Heard a lot about this restaurant but tried it for the first time. The restaurant is quite big with buffet sections well spread on either side of entry. I had the best mushroom soup of my life here. Rest of the food also tasted very good. Tamara Bheja fry was the stand out dish among the ones i tried. Desserts were also good. Overall it is worth of all what i heard about the place. Would love to visit again.,2
"Really enjoyed our meal at Tamra, Shangri La hotel. It had alot of options for everyone and age group. The food and service both were nice.",2
"Very good restaurant in the heart of the capital of India.
Good Food, special thanks to Chef Nisa Yimthong for her delicious food from Asian Cuisine.",2
I really loved the place. Ambience was lit. If you're looking for a fancy buffet with amazing dishes then this is the place. Everything was well cooked. Their Egg Tarts is a must try. Service could have been better.,2
"Great food, wonderful service, very nice people who work there‚Ä¶ Akash and Sachin chef and Vikash are just lovely! Place highly recommended.",2
Great ambience and tasty food. Very beautiful view from the table. I ate the buffet. Everything was great however I found 2 cons- water was charged at 325 a bottle and found the variety of dishes a little on the lesser side,2
"So, basically this place serves you a wonderful buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner where you can find different sections for different cuisines.Had an amazing experience with this restaurant.Highly recommended in terms of ambience, hospitality, sitting arrangement üëç",2
"Went for a team lunch in Nov'17.I was blown away by the variety of food from various parts of the world.They had 3 live counters - Chinese, Peshawari and Continental.Even the veg dishes were looking splendid and tasted delicious.They even had Sushi and the salad bar also had lots of options.The Desserts counter was so elaborate that I think they had 40+ items in desserts.The staff was very polite and amiable.The ambience was lovely and interiors looked plush as expected.Food - 5/5Service - 4.5/5Ambience - 4.5/5",2
"Beautiful lunch buffet.. More than the taste ( because already had sthg), I liked the presentation.. They have Japanese, Thai, Mughlai, Lebanese, Chaat, North Indian in the buffet.. I wish I felt hungrier but unfortunately didnt as I arrived too late for breakfast buffet and too early for lunch buffet..so had coffee and a lil sthg a-la-carte.. So couldn't sample a lot of stuff.. Full marks on hospitality! One Mr Anup even showed me around the entire hotel (other restaurants and cafes within the premises) I'd go again with an empty stomach üòÑüòÑ",2

"I went to this restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday. We choose to go for A la carte. We ordered kebab platter, Khao Soi soup, green thai curry and pad thai noodles. All dishes were vegetarian. Khao Soi soup is a MUST TRY. I really liked the flavors in that soup. Kebab platter was also good, except makkai palak ki shammi as it was very dry. Green thai curry was also okay. It can be done better if the spice level can be adjusted as per customers preference. The worst was the pad thai noodles, it didn't had salt and was under-cooked, flavors were missing. But there service and ambience was excellent. They also brought a mini cake to celebrate my mom's birthday. Overall my experience was okay.",1
"We stayed at the shangrila for 3 nights and were at Tamara 3 days for breakfast and one night for dinner. Chef Ravi, Chinna and Prerana were awesome. They chatted with us to find out what we liked and made sure we had it in our table when we went in for our next meal. Prerana was so friendly she took time to talk to us about the various foods and delicacies at the restaurant.Thanks to all of them for making our visit special.",2
This is my first time at tamra. I searched this place on google and just wanted to give it a try. Ambience of this restaurant is very very nice so pretty and classy. Decor was very beautiful. Fingerlicious menu. They have the buffet options as well. Firstly the cake was super delicious as it was my colleague‚Äôs birthday he totally loved the cake. Lasagna was so juicy and tempting. I can‚Äôt get enough of lasagna. Dal makhni was the yummiest and the paneer dosh was totally complimenting the paratha. I would totally give this restaurant 5/5 I am looking forward to plan more and more events and meals for my friends and family. Love you tamra you live up to my expectations. üòç,2
"Tamra is good for buffet esp if you are a non vegetarian. For vegetarians, the buffet is less of a good deal though it's reasonable if you compare it to the Ala carte prices. Also you should be comfortable with Japanese, oriental and continental cuisines. Our group had a lady who only wanted to eat North Indian vegetarian and so we ordered Ala carte. It was strictly ok. Nothing much to write home about.The hotel is of course beautiful",2
Very nice buffet restaurant located in the Shangri-La hotel in New Delhi near Connaught Place. Very good food but very expensive. I spent $230 USD on a buffet dinner and a single bottle of wine for my wife and myself. The breakfast buffet was also good and was included with our hotel stay. The food is excellent but still overpriced compared to similar places in Delhi. Vishal was an excellent member of the staff.,2
"Rahul K. was the best. He was courteous, kind and the food was perfection! I suggest ordering a cappuccino to start your meal and if you love spicy,savory mouth watering dishes order the chicken roll  you won't regret it I promiseüòãüòâ",2
It was a great experience visiting this restaurant..for Dinner with my family..Staff is very much friendly here and should be appreciated..dessert platter is a very good option..if you're a true sweet lover..if you like explore different taste of chat..must try...Amazing buffet style..can try cocktails over here..Vegetarian options: Good quality of vegetarian foods are available,2
One with a diverse menu... Multiple cuisines... With state of the art food... Had an amazing satisfying experience... The staff was courteous with ever smiling faces... You can swipe though some of the pictures uploaded by me..,2
"Fantastic spread. So many different cuisines.Indian, Continental, Oriental, Japanese, live counters, cold cuts etc etc. Their Continental food is par excellence. Delicious mushroom prepration, veg au gratin, stuffed tomatoes and brocolli, grilled fish and prawns, thai curries, Indian curries... Highly satisfying . Truly impressed with the food, service and ambience.Loved the spread of desserts.. Coffee cake, walnut tart, fresh fruit cake, waffles, chocolate cake, Indian mithais.. Everything was outstanding..Bright and beautiful Christmas tree and other Christmas decorations liven up the mood.",2
Awesome place. Too many cuisines for buffet. Cheese were so fresh and sushi were delicious too,2
"Tamra at Shangri-la is hosting an interesting food festival where they are showcasing the dishes from royal kitchens of india, from Kashmir to Rampur to lucknow to rajasthan to Patiala and Hyderabad. So you get to taste from Haleem to tabak mazz to the famous kormas. I went there couple of days ago and enjoyed the food! My favourite was mutton korma, galauti kebabs and murg mussalam ( I ate this after more than 30 years). Food is absolutely tasty and one shouldn‚Äôt miss it.  And not to forget Shahi tukra and seviyan ka muzzaffar. Festival is on till 17th of March.",2
"One of the restaurant in shanghri-la.They had seperate restaurants for Italian and Chinese.Tamra is a multi cuisine restaurant in the first floor. Even in the odd hours it's crowded and in the peak hours you have to book table early. I took buffet in which they had a good varieties of dishes in starters, main course and desserts, both in veg and non-veg.Staffs were very polite and helpful.Looking forward to visit again hopefully.",2
"What a place . It‚Äôs my favourite . Wonderful staff , wonderful food and amazing view . You can‚Äôt miss this place if you are a food lover .4000 for 2 is good if you are not drinking . Go for it .",2
One of the best breakfast and lunch buffet I have taken. Well arranged spread  with vivid varieties. I'm visting here for more often and everytime I enjoy the variety of dishes offered.,2
"Service was very poor,which is the first thing people expect from five star restaurant,Staffs and chefs were Ill mannered and unprofessional ,both words would not be able to describe their behaviour.Some food section did't have any staffs or servers.Ambience was very poor and congested.Buffet had some spread ,but not even one section was worth eating, they served pasta which was uncooked.Didn't even served japanese food even after mentioning it.All items from starters to desert were tasteless,even local restaurants food tastes far better than it.It was wastage of my money and time ,and worst decision I have made.I could have gone better places..They didn't served us even after asking for thrice ,we had to ask many times to clean the table and for water.I will not recommended it to anyone.",0
"Tamra is a multi-cuisine restaurant at Shangri-la Hotel offering upscale, vibrant, lively and fun space suited to all types of dining occasions.We had dined here for Lunch buffet which was one of the best I ever had. It served us authentic South East Asian cuisine as well as Indian and European fare, literally giving 'out of the world' culinary experience.I really loved the experience we had at Tamra. The atmosphere was energetic and colorful.Just loved the food and service too. The variety was vast and impressive, both in veg and non veg sections. Delectable taste.My most favorites here are Saute Vegetables, Focaccino Bread, Salad and dressings, Tiramisu Pastry, Fresh Fruits Tart, Mango Vanilla Slice, Coffee Ice Cream.Loved it all üòç‚ù§",2
"Been there for a couple of times. I must say the service take a quite time in serving the food. Regardless, the foods taste good and ambience is nice. A bit overpriced. That's all I can say",2
"Always heard of Shangri-la as one of the best places to dine in Delhi, so I thought of trying it out. Having a lot of expectations from reviews from friends and family, I have already been to Tamra twice. The food, drinks, ambience and the service is nothing less than spectacular!",2
Tamra restaurant is located at shangri la hotel in New Delhi. It‚Äôs from my some of the favourite restaurants because food is very good at this place. The staff is also very good and nice. You should definitely try their moctails and burgers. It‚Äôs a must visit place.,2
Variety- Absolutely hugeNeed to add maincourse dishes to Indian food menu.Taste of food- 7/10Deserts- I will say nice 8/10Service was good and prompt.,2
This was my second visit..it was so flooded with people today..it sacred me..no covid protocol...it was already late for me to leave the place..they were serving buffet..services were delayed..we were not attended to properly..it felt like sitting in a 2 star restaurant at the price of 5 star..even the staff was confused and in haste and impolite..even for water we had to ask many times..this was exactly opposite to my last time visit when they were happy to serve and we had a good time.,0
Amazingg... with a super vibe and good ambience. Food is delicious. People working there are way so much sweet.,2
"Decent spread, delicious food. Ate there for 2 consecutive days and the spread varied quite a bit especially the Mediterranean and salad section. The chaat push cart is a nice touch. Gives tourists the opportunity to taste an Indian Street snack without the fear of unstoppable toilet visits. Japanese counter should offer sashimi instead of just sushi and maki. 2500++ for dinner which adds up to around 3.3k rupees.",2
This  experience of a Sunday brunch was really awesome with a lovely spread.very difficult to say what was more good than the other .Highly recommended,2
"Great food spread, amazing ambience. Value for money .",2
"If there is a heaven for foodies, it is here. The buffet at the restaurant especially the Sunday brunch is infinitely amazing.The endless counters of different cuisines will leave you dumbfounded. They have grill sections, tawa fry sections, roast sections, bake sections and more. Their bake section has different types of breads, cookies, donuts, cakes and pastries. They have an Indian section which has the dosas, pani pooris, fried rice and more. Their chinese counter has a lot of boiled sea food and veggies. They have a drinks counter with a 100 combination of drinks. The fruits sections encompasses all fruits, even the rare dragonfruit, strawberries and more. They have a few cheese varieties on display. They even have north indian desserts often such as dhokla and phaphda.The juice counter has canisters full of different flavours of juice, namely lime, ginger lime, tender coconut, mango, orange, water melon and maybe musambi. Refill as much as you want. The milk section has skimmed milk, toned milk, yoghurt and an assortment of corn flakes and other flakes. Even salmon and salami are up for grabs.The dessert section is just enchanting. You may get live prepared pancakes. Choco lava cake and live candy is mostly available. Marshmallows, cheesecakes, ice creams, and seasonal desserts are available.be prepared to eat till you die because the price does burn a hole in your pocket, but if you've got the appetite for it, then it is totally worth it.",2
Good ambience. Nice staff and nice service. Pasta could have done a little better. All n all i had a great experience.,2
"Breakfast was good, the ambiance was also
Very good, the Staff was very nice in serving us. If any one is around, should visit this place for breakfast..!!",2
"We weren‚Äôt hotel guest but we tried Tamra Restaurant for breakfast. Upon the arrival, we were greeted warmly by the restaurant staff and promptly attended to our request.We ordered the Indian Breakfast of Akuri with Ajwaini Parantha and Uttapam. For drinks we ordered a coffee and sweet lassi.The breakfast was fantastic.The Akuri was served warm and the omelette was nicely spiced with the turmeric.Would strongly recommend the Uttapam. It was crispy and went well with the chutney.The lassi and the coffee was great!",2
"Enjoyed a lazy Sunday afternoon Brunch, amazing food, even better presentation. I was spoilt for choice.
The only drawback being the price.",2
"Buffet was very good,they have indian,thai,japanese and a chaat counter as well.Very decent and helpful staff.For vegetarians,the options are a bit less but for non-vegetarians,its a delight.",2
"Located on first floor of Shangri-la Eros delhi, it's a fine place with gorgeous ambience and gives the vibes of elegance. Food is top notch and must recommended.",2
"Title: Extremely Disappointing ExperienceI recently had the unfortunate opportunity to dine at Tamra Restaurant, and  I must say it was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. From start to finish, nearly everything went wrong, leaving me utterly disappointed.First and foremost, the service was abysmal. The staff appeared disinterested and lacked basic courtesy. It took an excruciatingly long time for anyone to acknowledge our presence, and even then, they seemed annoyed by our presence. Our server was inattentive and forgetful, frequently mixing up our orders and displaying a complete lack of knowledge about the menu.As for the food, it was nothing short of a disaster. The dishes arrived cold, poorly presented, and lacking any semblance of flavor. It was evident that no care or attention was given to the preparation. The ingredients seemed stale and tasteless, as if they had been sitting around for far too long. Even simple dishes like salads were disappointingly bland and lacked freshness.To make matters worse, the restaurant's ambiance was dismal. The decor was outdated, and the seating arrangements were uncomfortable. The noise level was unbearable, making it difficult to hold a conversation without shouting. It seemed as though no effort was made to create a pleasant atmosphere for diners.In terms of value for money, the prices were exorbitant considering the quality of the food and service provided. I would have gladly paid a premium for a satisfying dining experience, but what I received was far from that. It felt like a complete rip-off.Overall, I cannot recommend Tamra Restaurant to anyone. It was a truly disappointing and disheartening experience. From the terrible service to the tasteless food and lackluster ambiance, this establishment fell far below even the lowest of expectations. Save your time and money and look for a better dining option elsewhere.",0
The best dal Makhani you can find in Delhi. I went there post dinner just to try that dish and it was way better than my expectations.There are many hotels in Delhi which claim to serve the best dal makhani but are simply overratedIt was Diwali evening and the hospitality of the staff was incredible. Didn't feel like we were having Diwali dinner away from homeIt is probably one of the very few restaurants in Delhi with a great view of the central vista,2
Overall its good to go but I personally found lesser options for vegetarians in comparison to non vegetarian menu.,2
It was great time spent with family with good quality of food and excellent ambience and service. I highly recommend this restaurant.,2
"Thanks for making my birthday more special.!!Shangri-La has always been on my favorite list.Tamra Restaurant has bountiful of options for making your table more decorative.We opted for A la carte...ordered Vegetarian Veg Platter for starters ,loved the presentation and it equally tasted awesome.In Main Course -Mathania Mirch Paneer-Best Delicacy...5/5,Dal Makhani-perfect creamy texture 5/5,Murg Makhani Malai -properly moist ,produce was tender in mild tomato gravy 4/5,Bhuna Palak Malai-2.5/5 not tasted well.Breads /Rice were perfect.Staff was proactive and courteous.Would love to come back again.!!Thanks Tamra for the Food, Service, Warmth, Flavour, Love & a great memory!!",2
One of the best restaurants in New Delhi for sure. In most of the hotels they will leave atleast one bad thing while dining but I haven't felt anything bad here.1. Clean & Nice Ambience2. Kind & helpful service3. Good quantity & quality of food4. Value for money5. Family friendly,2
"The buffet spread was amazing. Had a great dinner at Tamra at the Shangri-La hotel. The service was great, in particular Rahul who helped us with everything and made a memorable night even better. Thanks again, Rahul!",2
Good spread of the Buffet Dinner with flavours of Delhi street food as well as global cuisine. Don't miss out the dimsums.,2

"Good food, amazing service and very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Loved it alot.",2
"The buffet is always at its best. 5 stars; be it veg or non-veg food. And desserts are specially awesome.
Love this place.",2
Good for non vegetarians. Some new dishes added. Not so good for vegetarians. Desert section was seriously lacking in depth.,1
"This restaurant has it all ambience,view of the grand central Delhi streets, polite staff & amazing food and dessert took away my heart.Went there with my mom, dad and brother. All four of us came out happy & satisfied with the experience.Every dish we tasted had it's own identity in terms of taste and originality.",2
"This place has one of the most vast buffet spread when it comes to the variety of food. One can binge on global food cuisine having the best of everything. Generally when restaurants provide with a vast variety of food in a buffet they tend to short fall on either taste part or the quality of food, but at Tamra, they literally provide you with the best of everything. Even their average tasting dishes tasted better than most of the restaurants of same stature. Their desserts section was also one of the best in class, they even had a liquid  chocolate fountain churning both white and milk based chocolate into perfection.This place has a pretty good number of live stations which actually makes the whole experience a tad better as compared to other restaurants. Cherry on top was the way their server greeted everyone. A big thumbs up to all the staff members.Star dishes : White Sauce Pasta ( THE MOST CREAMIEST AND RICH SAUCE ), Dimsums, Teppanyaki Vegies, Sauted Mushroom in white sauce, Avacado Sushi. ( Based on personal preference. Almost everything else was also as good as any of the above dishes )",2
"I am a regular guest to Tamra restaurant @ shangrila. They have taken utmost care to serve the guests maintaining all the safety precautions during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.I need to mention especially Mr Deepak, Restaurant Manager  is very courteous, polite and helpful to each and every guest and adds warmth to dining experience. If you‚Äôre near CP , don‚Äôt miss to dine at Tamra for a wonderful dining experience.",2
"Multi cuisine, fine dining, wide variety of cultural food experience.Couple and kids friendly.Parking: Valet parking available",2
"I visited Tamra for lunch with my family. While the restaurant had a great ambience, the service was very poor. I ordered from the √Ä la carte menu, while my family went with the buffet. My panini tasted alright (why the HUGE bell peppers!?), and I was told that the buffet food was bland. What really bothered us though was the attitude of the staff. Our water glasses were not refilled, nobody checked on our order when it was late, and one of the staff boys at the buffet service area who was serving us told us it is not his job to clear the table and we should ""ask the waiters to do that "". Quite the attitude.I have been here pre-COVID times and my experience was great back then. But I guess the hotel doesn't care about its guests anymore, so I'll save myself the hassle and them the inconvenience and find myself a new lunch spot.",0
"Tamra Restaurant offers a diverse range of cuisines, catering to different tastes and preferences. From Indian delicacies to Asian, Mediterranean, and more, the menu has something for everyone. The dishes were presented beautifully and tasted absolutely delicious. The flavors were authentic, and the ingredients used were of high quality. I particularly enjoyed their selection of seafood dishes, which were fresh and perfectly cooked.",2

"For a start I will not be writting here that I found hair in my food no. We decided to treat ourselves at Tamara for our 25th. Booked a table, so far so good. The general welcome and ambience of the hotel is very good. The staff welcomed us and we got a table near the Japanese counter, next to the window. Unfortunately we noticed that they were storing used plates not very far from our table behind a pillar. The used plates may not have been visible to the rest of the guests but we had a good view of Delhi and the used plates.There were a variety of cuisines. We started with the Japanese soup and had a few nibbles of the other cuisines. The cheese and other cuisines tasted alright. We then turned our attention to the Indian section as nothing beats our ""desi khana"". What a massive disappointment it was. They seem to prepared the dishes as per some Indian version of the western palate and have thus heavily played around with them. Every single Indian dish whether veg or non-veg was bland and lacking any flavours. You know what tasted the best, their dal and rice. I live in the UK and can tell you that the British love flavoursome and spicy Indian food. My biggest disappointment is reserved for the kebabs, they were lukewarm. Those kebabs should have never been served in a five star restaurant charging top dollar. Tamara's Indian dishes are a disgrace and insult to the Indian food.My only two suggestions would be1. Stop storing used plates behind that pillar take a few steps and take them to the kitchen2. Improve flavours of your Indian dishes. There's no need to bast*rdise them anymore.Given the tourists and locals in Delhi this place will keep doing good business, but unfortunately we wont be going back.",0
A very classy restaurant with menu containing international range of recipes. The waiters and the staff treated me with immense respect and hospitality. I tried the Khao Soi under the category 'Thai specialities' in the menu card which was super delicious which made me order it again. One of the best restaurant in Delhi.,2
Best restaurant ever i have visit last 2-3 years. Their cuisines is very tasty. They serve best sushi you can ever had in other restaurants. Lots of varaity in sushi they serve. Restaurant vibe is perfect to hang out with friends and family. Do visit,2
"Amidst covid era, Tamra takes satisfactory precautions along with delicious food .
Tom yam bangkok soup is a must try.",2
"While the restaurant had an upscale ambiance, I couldn't help but feel disappointed by the high prices in comparison to the taste of the food.when it came to the food, it fell short of my expectations. The menu featured a variety of dishes that sounded promising, but the taste didn't quite justify the steep prices. The portions were decent but didn't compensate for the lackluster flavors.",2
"This restaurant was in my ‚Äòto visit‚Äô bucket list since a long time and honestly, I had a mixed experience here.Starting with ambience, the place has a royal themed ambience and they use very heavy and beautiful cutlery and crockery.The staff is super polite, prompt and professional. They are very learned as well.So no complaints there.Coming to the food, this was the most disappointing aspect.The food taste was mediocre at best.It felt like their Chef is very obsessed with cumin powder and coriander seeds as almost all the dishes had overpowering notes of these 2 spices.I really wouldn‚Äôt recommend their Kadhai Paneer and Garlic Naan.Garlic naan was very undercooked and not crispy at all.It was very soft and thick which made it very hard to chew.Paneer Tikka was really good though.Also, personally, I felt that the taste of the food doesn‚Äôt justify the prices they charge.300 rupees for masala papad?Not justified at all.Overall, a decent place to visit with your family and friends, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it highly.",1
Good ambience. Average food. Good for family dinners. Good service. Opens a little late in the noon and definitely not according to time mentioned anywhere.,1
"It‚Äôs always delight to brunch with mom specially when it‚Äôs around Mother‚Äôs Day l!It‚Äôs a nice place if you love Indian food and relish traditional Indian spices !We ordered some nice mouthwatering kebabs and sumptuous vada pao and chaat !With some great clicks and talks , we decided to go for main course and ordered mushroom do pyaza , chicken korma along with garlic naan and lachcha paranthaThe service is really nice and the cutlery is so dedicated to the theme that I really clicked few nice videos too",2
"I and my best friend recently visited this super amazing cafe and tried from starters to sweets. Everything was super tasty and the presentation was really exciting. The scrumptious food, good ambience and a presentation, what else do we want? I and my friend are really happy with each and everything.",2
"Recently visited this amazing place to try some authentic pan indian food. The ambience concept is dedicated to the national highway of India which is amazing. The food presentation is very unique specially the Shamsheer Kebab (star dish). Tastewise the food is delectable, absolutely loved the dahi kebabs. Butter chicken and dal makhani are a must try. Also the jaljeera mojito was super refreshing. Must visit place!",2
"Not a popular place. Was empty/deserted when we arrived. Five out of seven menu items ordered were not available. We had to choose from whatever was available. E.g. Keema-pav from the menu couldn't be ordered because they don't keep Pav. :-(Prices are exorbitant. Taste, preparation and presentation isn't commensurate.Not well maintained. The cutlery drawer and cassette Aircon were pathetic. Chandeliers had several fused bulbs.Disappointing for a Connaught place restaurant.Vegetarian options: Many veg options were in the menu but not available by saying those were seasonal.Wheelchair accessibility: Not very convenient.",0
"NH44 is a Pan India Cuisine Restaurant which is portraying delicacies from J&K to Kanyakumari. Their ambience and choice of interior work is fantastic and so is their service. Their food presentation is top notch and have a concept of fine dining which they are doing it very well.Now coming about food, You are welcomed with a drink which was delicious and served in a small cute copper cups. I tried both North and South delicacies and each dish I tried was very delicious and portioned very well. The thing that I missed from the menu is Amritsari Kulcha‚Äôs and paranthas which is a major dish you find in Highway Dhabas in the North.The price point is great as per the ambience and service they are giving. Overall I had a great experience at NH 44 would love to dine again soon!Update 2:After wonderful experience last time I had, I took my family and friends to gather around for a good evening but this time everything was awful around here, no-one was bothering to take orders, no welcome drinks like last time, after asking several time they gave menu card and again vanished away. After waiting around 20 mins one staff came to take order and our starters took around 1 hour to come and soon after starter was served they came with main course. This time food was also bad. I believe that all the chefs and old staffs have left the place. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone now and other people were facing same issue like us. Even after complaining to so called Manager he wasn‚Äôt even bothered about it.",0
"I recently visited this restaurant with my best friend for lunch after reading amazing reviews about it and let me tell you it is true that they do have great north indian cuisine food. It's a perfect restaurant for your lunches and dinners with family and friends. It is a highway themed restaurant which is quite fascinating. We ordered kurkure khumb, paneer tikka, dahi ke kebab along with long island iced tea and some mocktails. A special mention about kurkure khumb, they were the best we ever had, a delight for all mushroom lovers. Dahi ke kebab and paneer tikka were good too. The Long island iced tea was just perfect. Mocktails were good too. For main course, we ordered dal makhani and tawa paneer masala along with lachha paratha, aloo naan, garlic naan and butter roti. The dal makhani was so perfect that we ended up over eating with the paneer and breads. For desserts, we ordered phirni and shahi tukda which were amazing too. Do try this place for the Kurkure Khumb, Dal Makhani, long island iced tea and phirni.Vegetarian options: Good options for vegetariansParking: Good parking space",2

Visited this place with a friend for dinner. It's a multi-cuisine restaurant and we decided to have a very basic dinner of Chicken Dum Biryani and Yakhni Shorba. The food was Okay and the presentation could have been better. The ambience is suitable if you are looking for a quiet place where you can chat with a friend over a meal. It's also open till late so that's an added advantage.,2
"I was in this resturant 2 months ago because it's location near to Radison blu hotel in CP where I was staying.In the same place 2 resturants, Chinese resturant (Oriental Garden) upstairs and Indian resturant downstairs, I tried both, the Chinese was amazing, but unfortunately the Indian was bad and I couldn't eat all what I ordered.",0

A well know restaurant have now started their new branch at Cp. The staff was extremely courteous and welcoming. It was quite chilled inside despite the Delhi heat outside and even at times I wished I was carrying a blazer.The element of surprise happened when we sat down  and was looking attentively at the menu. There was a sudden sound of a cycle bell. Startled I looked up to find that our welcome drink has arrived that was Aam PannaTo begin with we started with a Non Veg platter of NH 44 that has varieties on the chicken dish. The kebabs were tasty and succulent to meet our taste buds.Next we ordered Garlic Nan and chicken rezala. I liked it though I felt the chicken was not well made and could have been cooked a bit more.They do serve alcohol and the service is good. The toilet is on the 1st floor accessible by staircase and is beside their Chinese joint.It would not be a bad idea to visit to celebrate a special occasion,2
"A brand new place in the heart of Delhi, Connaught Place has opened up recently with Pan Indian cuisine. Recently went here with my friends and really loved it.The welcome drinks they serve are so refreshing, it just makes you prepared for what's coming next.

The staff is pretty amazing and give a great hospitality. Would love to be here again!",2
"This place is so so good and appropriate for family, friends and get together. The interiors and the food speaks for itself. Really enjoyed their Starters - Paneer tikka and Dahi ke kebab. Don't forget to try Gulab jamun and phirni, their one of the best dessert.",2

I ordered some himachali kangda kebabs which is something i will definitely try again.Even i all time favourite dish Butter chicken was good here. Very well balanced spices and it was tangy. Paired it with lachcha paratha and some green apple chutney.,2
Top class place to taste different cuisine which range from Jammu to all the way to Kanyakumari.Highly recommended place if you love to encounter differ cuisines at one place.The brownie points to the management and the hospitality they had given. Truly impressive.One plus point is the way of giving the welcome drink.,2
"Recently visited this fine dine restaurant. It has a totally different vibes. Ambiance is just perfect with comfortable seating & soulful music playing in the background.Coming to food, their starters were too good. I had Palak Patta Chaat in which there were crispy palak served along with curd, pomegranate seeds etc on top. Taste was amazing.Next, Kurkure khumb were quite unique. It was crispy on the outside and mushroom i.e. khumb inside. I loved the texture overall.Also tried their paneer tikka which was visually mouth watering. There were huge pieces of Chargrilled Paneer marinated with delectable spices.In main course, I wanted to try kathal biryani but it was unavailable so I ended up with Subz Biryani which was served along with mix veg raita & papad. Presentation was unique & taste was also good.In drinks, ""Hum Sath Sath Hain"" mocktail was very refreshing. It was presented with sliced apple on top.Overall, I had an amazing experience dining there. Loved the interior. Service was good. Their Salt shaker was different & cute. Instead of hankerchief, they kept apron along with plate which I found good & different.Washroom were also clean and well maintained. Alas, a must visit place with either your family or friends.",2

As that is one dish I really crave for but never get in usual north indian restaurants.I had it with the tandoori rooti and it was an absolute delight.The place was very hygienic and soft music was playing , overall the ambience was very good.It certainly is a value for money place to visit.",2
Newly opened place in CP serving some amazing North Indian food . Started with some tandoori chicken and dahi kebabs . Here service was good and food was amazing . In mains you should definitely try out their butter chicken which was creamy and full of flavours.,2
"NH 44 is a concept restaurant serving cuisines from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.Drawing inspiration from India's longest highway,the place serves authentic and choicest cuisines and picked keeping in mind the states that touch this highway.The ambience is bright and there's simple table sitting with books and corners decorated with sculptures and show pieces.The menu is simple yet exquisite.They serve ""Aam panna shots"" as welcome drink.We ordered Italian smooch and jal jeera mojito to begin and Mushroom galauti and Maharaja patiala sword kabab for starters.The sword kababs were flambe on the table with rum and were delicately flavored.Very unsual serving and quite interesting taste.The mushroom galauti was mouth melting and never felt like a vegetarian speciality.The drinks are awesome here,Italian smooch was ginger ale based and jal jeera mojito is a humble version of Jain shinkanji on highways.The main course was Daal makhni,makhni chooza and chicken dum biryani.The best part about their presentations is use of small degha which keep the curries warm.The recipes are so simple and authentic that no empowering ingredient like heavy creams or butter can be felt.The chicken is delicate and dal makhani is simply soulful.The Malabar parantha complemented them perfectly.Biryani is served with raita and it's nicely made with big grain basmati rice fully cooked in dum with marinated chicken.A complete fish in itself,i can come here just for their biryani.The gastronomical evening ended with phirni.As delicate as it can get,server in earthenware and highlight of evening.To sum up,it's one the best place for Indian food lovers who need variety and great ambience.",2
"Been to this fine dining restaurant with my friends. I really liked the hanging chandelier on their ceiling and entrance India Map was perfect to take a picture with.I ordered Ludhiana laal Paneer Tikka, Kurkure Khumb, Mushroom Galouti Kebab & Aloo Chaat. Their presentation skills are quite good. Cheers to that! Paneer Tikka literally came on a Manji. That somehow gave Dhaba like feeling sitting in a Fine-Dine. Paneer Tikka was lip smacking, Kurkure Khumb were delicious, Mushroom Galouti melted in my mouth & Aloo Chaat was very well presented too.I also tried their Gulab Jamun & it was piping hot and delectable.

Recently visited this place for lunch. And it was an amazing experience. The food was really scrumptious. Just love the ambience of this place. Staff was so courteous.,2
#Pathetic and #Scam1. Service is very poor.. the person who was serving us had zero knowledge about the menu.2. There was two types of laccha paratha.. mint and chilli.  We ordered one each.. they gave mint and plain laccha.. when we asked they said they can't replace the wrong item which is plain laccha.. when we insisted they took the plain laccha.. and sprinkled a lots of red chilli powder on it and served it back.. W#F... it was smelling of raw chilli powder..3. We ordered some mutton item.. 2 prices of mutton was left because we couldn't eat the red chilli powder dressed laccha...!! So we asked the waiter to pack thoese two pieces with the gravy.. once we opened the box after reaching home surprisingly there was no mutton pieces.. ONLY Gravy with lots of Oil.. what a #SCAM.4. They also charged 10% service charge which we asked them to remove.. but they forced us to pay..Management should look into this review..#poorservice #scam,0
"NH44 is a great family restaurant. As the name suggests, it serves food of almost every state covered by NH44. The food is really good and ambience is very cosy. They serve main course dishes on a stand with tea lights beneath the dish, so the dish remains hot throughout. Loved this concept-My recommendations- Dahi Kebab, Kukad Malai Wali Dal Makhani and Rara Meat.",2
Beautiful place with wide menu and multiple delicacies under one roof. Their Dal Makhni is definitely a must try and can't drool enough for the Shahi Tukda ‚ù§Ô∏è,2

Walking down the CP street and reaching NH 44 is vibing. The authenticity of Indian food and presentation is remarkable. But if you planning to go please book your table in advance and keep calm you might have to wait.,2
One of the best places of serving fine dining in cp. Food quality and taste is too delectable. üòãConcept behind it is unique. üëåüèªIt's a must try cafe if you love north Indian food.  Ambience is aesthtic.üí´,2

"If you‚Äôre searching for a place with beautiful ambiance & great food in Connaught place, look no further than NH44.It‚Äôs a new restaurant but already made a place in our hearts with their amazing food. They were serve dishes from over 14+ states, from Srinagar to Kanyakumari, the same states in which national highway 44 goes through. We tried some of their dishes and here‚Äôs few things that we recommend. First is Nh44 spl fire tandoori chicken, this one is something that shouldn‚Äôt be missed. The chicken had stuffing inside, perfectly cooked & the taste was heavenly. For main course, their dal makhni, butter chicken & rogan josh are the best, especially paired with butter naan. And don‚Äôt forget to take a glass of refreshing mojito & fruit punch.",2
Best food ever. The ambiance was great totally loved it. The presentation was upto mark. The staff was friendly and helpful. Definately recommended. Nice quantity and quality at effective price.,2

"Food: 5/5Ambience: 5/5Service: 4/5Affordability: 3/5From the concept to ambience and food. No doubt they did a great job. They have a welcome drink that is super delicious. Highly recommended if you like northern Indian food.But NH44 is quite expensive and registering from dine out is a loophole.You have to bear the service charge which is 10% on the bill and the same 10% discount you receive from Dine Out during payment. As a result, you may feel that you have saved money, but that is not the case. So be sure to know the T&C of Restaurant which is available on Dine out.",2
"Recently visited this place in CP. They serve dishes from all the states that fall on nh44. I tried their vadapav, palak patta chaat, dal makhani, kadhai paneer. You should definitely try their Vadapav. The ambience of the place is also really good.",2

Nice place to have lunch ‚Ä¶ cosy and clean. The lady who served us today was quite nice üëçüèº and polite to start off with. It has a bar and we were unfortunate that it was a Monday in office üòâ The 4.9 rating actually helped in pushing us to try this restaurant.

I actually will try it again if I travel back to Delhi for some reason !!!,2
"An awesome experience overall, with great ambiance, delicious food and soothing music. Wonderful hospitality. Highly recommended.",2
"This is a unique restaurant which has a large menu, but when you order their specials, as stated on the menu, they are out of stock.We went as a group of 6 people, whatever we wanted to eat was out of stock. Mind you, these were all the specials according to the menuWe had whatever was available, the taste was just alright. Nothing too great. Service was disappointing. Servers didn't know what they were doing. Some dishes were missing from our order when it arrived on the table, we had to remind them what we ordered, there was definitely some argument in the kitchen among the staff, we could hear it clearly.One of the worst dining experience I've had in delhi so far. Not going here again",0
"I went to this place today as I have read about it in an article. Let's start with drinks. As I went with my 3 other friends. They ordered liquor with some starters. They said   this restaurant does not have huge Variety of option in bar menu. Now let's talk about staff, their were Okay sort. Music was poor and sleepy. I asked them to change music twice but they didn't changed it. In last we order taka tak sabzi, Shahi paneer, malai kofte with butter Naan and pudina paratha. It this taste fantastic. Main course was good. In the end we pay through dineout and got 10% discount.",2

"It was a nice evening at NH 44. Had starters, Shorbha soup, Nan and kadai chicken with desert.
Restaurant has a warm and nice ambience to spend time with family. Highly recommended for an outing.",2
"Worst place to be, Please try some where else, the food taste is worst, service is very poor, we need to wait almost 45 min for our food, Service is poor, Food is very poor & expensive also, beleive me you'll regret it after eating from there.",0
"We visited there on 22nd July 2023. Despite a confirmation call for booking, they forgot to tell us that there air conditioning was faulty. They didn‚Äôt even tell us when we reached there. We had to send back 4 bowls of chutney as it had bubbles in it indicating that it was fermented and spoilt. The chicken was rubbery and had no taste. They did not have adequate fans/coolers. And we had to sit in humid and hot weather. Couldn‚Äôt even leave as wouldn‚Äôt have got a place for 10 people at 8:30 pm in cp on a Saturday night. Not visiting there again.",0
"Food was great, everything we ordered were nice, service was inattentive, they wouldn‚Äôt serve the accompaniments or add candle to the burner or forget to give cutleries. Atmosphere is stuffy and they played music from a corner on a poor speaker which was constantly annoying. They should rather use soothing music instead. They didn‚Äôt accept my credit card which was issued in Thailand for some reason",2
"Wonderful experience . very good environment, best service, quality of food and minimal waiting time.Every single dish we ordered was great. the chicken dishes and drinks definitely stood out.Must try tawa paneer & butter chicken and ParthaTo my ultimate, the prices were also very fair.",2
"""Pan Indian cuisine""is best for vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian their ambience and interior selection is best talking about cuisine is simply appetizing! Their flavourful dishes will blow you mind price is good for me I found worth paying...Desserts are divine",2
"Nice location, food taste is good but mis management. There very only 2-3 servers managing the entire place on a Saturday night. I think chefs are also limited because it took more than 30 mins for every dish we ordered. Rest the quality and taste is good.",0
Food is kind of average but they surely need to improve their service. There was total chaos regarding the order and starters came after the main course. In fact the ambience is also very average. They need to go a long way to compete with other restaurants nearby.,1
"This was the worst restaurant we visitedIt ruined our mood and all the birthday spiritsThe food was pathetic and all the dishes were not even availableWhatever videos and photos posted online are not available thereNo music no service.In veg we ordered Tawa paneer and Paneer 65, it was the worts I ever ate. They provided Tawa paneer without Tawa and Paneer 65 without crispyness.In non-veg, we ordered chicken and muttonFirst of all what we wanted was not there and whatever they had was patheticIf there was a negative rating I would have given that..",0
"Worst experience ever. Restaurant's labour started fighting amongst themselves and Manager was eating his dinner in front of the guests and was letting his labour fight in front of the guests. Bad food. Wet plates. Poor service. No service of water, salad inspire of reminders. Highly expensive in comparison to taste and portion size.",0
"Went on 13th June 2023 for a dinner with family after watching so much promotion on Insta n f.b.Services from staff was good.Ordered veg n n.veg food both,N.veg food was awesome in taste but veg food was not so good .Tandoori chicken,Mutton seekh,punjabi chicken biryani was too good.ButDaal makhni n malai kofta both were not cooked properly even garlic Naan wasn't crisp at all.Interiors of restaurant was dirty patches on walls, water was leaking from A.C.I was very excited for their patiala sword chicken Tikka but he staff told me, is not available today, I was surprised.All in all , food was good but the experience of dinning wasn't so good .Vegetarian options: Veg food was not upto the mark.N.veg food was awesome in taste.",2
"Decent food and our waiter was great. However, they failed to tell us their card machine was broken so we had to go to a local cash point. This cash point wasn‚Äôt working so we asked if we could pay in Dollars. The manager tried to charge us double the amount of the bill if we paid in dollars! He was so rude and ruined the evening. Luckily we found another cash point and managed to pay in cash. Not impressed with the service at the end. Poor management",0
Recently visited this amazing restaurant with my family and it was the great experience. We enjoyed a lot. They have really good ambience and scrumptious food. Everything was so reasonable in price and staff was so humble and polite. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place to everyone to go with your family and friends.,2

Worst Experience !!Got our order like 50mins of waiting. Magee and staff were clue less what has happened. Ordered sword Tangi kebab which they flame in front you. But that was not lit. And waiter says sorry today the person who flames the dish is on leave. Even for a cold drink they makes us wait for 20 mins. It‚Äôs was my parent‚Äôs anniversary and they ruined it all.Do not visit this restaurant. If you want to have these kind experience most welcome..Even I called for senior manger. He was a big level moron working is hospitality industry. No solution was provided.It‚Äôs run by Bhagwan k Bharose type style.All the best !! If you have considered this place for your dining experience.,0
"We tried,Dahi Kebabs: 2/5, nothing special.Chicken tikka, chef‚Äôs special: 3/5, taste was decent, nothing great.Butter chicken: -4/5, it tasted like shahi paneer gravy and chicken pieces. Absolute rubbish.Rara Mutton: 3/5, served cheap pieces and decent in taste.Chicken korma: 2/5, barely edible.Staff was helpful, however, despite of attending only two tables service was unapologetically lethargic.On top of everything the restaurant is exorbitantly expensive.",0
"The restaurant is beautiful, not very crowdy. The food is extremely delecious. From service point of view too they are very customer friendy. They offered to change our dish when we found it spicy, and they immediately changed it. The time of service is also goods.",2
"Good place for Indian/ mughlai cuisine. The place is situated on the outer circle, just opposite burger Singh. The food is good. We tried galwati kabab and daal makhani , both were good. Approx cost for 2 people would be around 2000 rupees. The ambience of the place is also good and not very crowded with good light music.",2
"I visited this restaurant last week for lunch , and i really liked theambience and food service.I ordered paneer tikka and dahi kebab , both were really good intaste and good in quantity too, It has a seating capacity of appx.100 people and the super quick service is the best thing.Pricing is justified by the taste and quality of food.",2
"The food is too good .
Service swlo but the staf  very friendly.  I was very enjoying this palace ... Love it",2
"We actually visited the Oriental Garden upstairs & the staff were polite. Upon returning downstairs, we asked for the Indian menu & initially their staff were courteous too. Upon enquiring a takeaway menu, a lady offered to send it as a PDF or click a pic (fine). However, she appeared to give disdainful looks towards us (are customers judged by their attire?) & whispered something to the other staff who then all deserted us.As we were shopping nearby, we had planned & conveyed to Oriental upstairs to return & get something packed. However, given the aloof atmosphere downstairs, we decided not to proceed...Given that most people were polite, I've still given them 3*s",1
"Had an amazing experience at this place ! Their food and service was too Good. I really liked the warm welcome they did. Their non veg food is a must must try . Loved their chicken starters , rara chicken , longest mutton seekh kebabs and also veg food items were decent . Loved that place.",2
Good testyIf you want to have best veg biryani around cp this is the place. Even for non veg and tawa paneer you will love their main course for sure. Also the hospitality is something which is worth mentioning!,2
"Recently visited here with the family, the place is on a perfect dine concept, they serve the crazy North Indian food, you should definitely give this place a try. They will never disappoint you with the taste and the quality of the food. I just loved the starters in chicken and the dal makhani was so smoothing, even I liked the mutton too, perfectly cooked. Do not miss the desserts, they are just amazing.",2
Most attractive place in delhi is Pan Indian Cuisine also Perfact place for done your meetings and nice place for click your photo and so beautiful place in inside amazing food and best service provider and testi food also ....

Do not dine in at the restaurant if you want to avail any discount. They misguide the customers saying that their Chinese outlet is upstairs and charge without any discount.Both oriental garden and national highway 44 staff is misguiding. We had to pay more than 50% in our bill due to their negligence.,0

Had lunch with my friends here. Food and ambiance not were really amazing. They have wide variety of pan indian dishes. Mutton Rogan josh and Seekh kebab was really delicious. All the drinks were perfect.,2
Tasty food at reasonable rates. It's a nice new hotel with clean washroom. Service is also quick with an average wait of 15min. There is also enough parking for cars so it's a good place to stop on road for good lunch or dinner. The only downside is no paper towels or rolls in washroom which is very inconvenient for tourists. Still I will rate it 5* for taste and price üëåüèª,2

"Kiyan is one of the top places in Gurugram for Lunch and Dinner. The property boasts an amazing atmosphere with scenic beauty and greenery.

Breakfast spread was decent for the buffet. Some more live counters would have done it for me. I felt they were running the show understaffed. I wish there were more runners on the floor to increase efficiency during my stay.Kiyan's indian flavors for lunch were exciting. The portion size and the taste for dal makhani and sheek kababs were perfect.Devil's Advocate - the tequila based cocktail pictured was beautifully curated and had some potency to it. Quite delicious I must say.The lighting and the decor of the restaurant was good due to right amount of daylight piercing in the room.Make sure the seating is organized in a way that it's easy to walk for the guests and staff during rush hours.Add some more staff so the guests enjoy the meals without delays.Overall - check it out for Indian cuisine and try out a cocktail.,2

He presented some of their signature dishes prepared from handpicked veggies from the farm by the chef himself.So it began with their signature drink which was apple juice with a hint of cinnamon and ginger ale it was indeed refreshing in this hot summer.Then we had the tomato soup which was served over orange slice and blanch cherry tomato along with focaccia bread. It was just so delicious , despite me being a non lover of soups , I just loved this tomato soup light yet flavorful.For the snacks we had the paneer tikka with mango marmalade inside, it was delicious combo.Next was pathar ke ghost, which mutton chunks grilled and delicious, for the main course we had the dal makhani paneer curry bhurji and nalli nihari",2

So not much from the waterside sitting. I don't like the idea with waterside sottong coz I visited in september.Not too much crowded and saftey measures are gud. About food,  quality is gud for some dishes like I ordered ranjitsahi paneer, i liked it. But I also ordered  salad and it's not even what I regularly order from swiggy. As per price quantity is very less. I m not amused by the food as ratings on the different diner platforms. So overall mixed experience with the place. My advise to go there in winters. And to kiyan mangament plse increase the quantity of food. Follow me on @adismax on instagram",2
"The ambience of the hotel is very nice and beautiful, you can enjoy your meal and the staff is also very polite and helpful . I love this place I will surely suggest every to visit once and take the  experience of their services",2
"Kiyan, the signature all day dining restaurant at The Roseate New Delhi.A visit to Roseate can best be termed as a luxurios  experience in the lap of nature, yes NATURE which is hard to find in Delhi.The mesmerizing ambience, beautifully manicured gardens, water bodies and lots of sparrows and colourful birds can be seen roaming around in the greens.It instantly reminded me of a resort in Kerala which I visited for my honeymoon 10 years back.Amidst this beautiful setting, be ready to satisfy your hungry stomachs with some lip smacking food  with ever attentive and polite but non-intruding service at Kiyan.We were served their welcome drink Moksha a refreshing drink and a bread basket with nicely baked breads with butter.There is no better feeling when you visit a restaurant and the chef comes to your table to greet you.The Chef Mr Anand Panwar was kind enough to come to our table and ask us about our food preferences and tastes.He informed us that they were having an ongoing  Bangkok food festival festival till 15th June so we made up our mind to have a Thai Lunch.We ordered the following :Wild Mushroom SoupBangkok Spring RollsThai Green Curry ChickenThai Red Curry ChickenPhad Thai GoongJasmin RiceCashew ChickenKiyan Signature DessertI must confess that I haven‚Äôt had a better Mushroom Soup than the one we were offered here. It cant get any better for sure, it packed the power punch of Mushroms with a presentation that was a visual delight.The consistency(thickness)  of the curries in Thai cuisine  varies with the amount of coconut milk used and here the consistency and the taste were just perfect for both Red & Green Curry.One could feel the flavours of  green chillies, shallots, garlic, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime peel, cilantro roots etc.Pad Thai Goong turned out to be a  perfect combination of the popular Pad Thai (rice noodle) and some crunchy prawns.Cashew Chicken was a burst of  flavours of tender peppers and onions with perfectly cooked golden brown chicken, and a sauce that will make you ask for more‚Ä¶Kiyan Signature dessert was the Toffee Coffee Pudding :Sticky toffee puddings can be unbearably sweet, but this one, flecked with ginger and coated in a coffee toffee sauce topped with Vanila Ice Cream  was perfect.Puddings don't get more gloriously indulgent than this one.Our sincere thanks to the Chef Mr Anand Panwar  for serving us a memorable meal.Will definitely come back with family for a weekend stay.",2
"We had a very nice dinner at Peshwari. Great ambiance, delicious food. Our waiter helped guide us to some great menu selections.A few notes on the negative side. They couldn't find our reservation even though we had a written email confirmation - turned out it wasn't a problem to get seated but the place ended up completely packed so it's a good thing we arrived early. Also, when our appetizers came out we had to ask for a fork and knife since there were none at the table. We had to ask 3 times before they were provided to us, and the manager's excuse was that these were really finger foods we should eat with our hands... And finally, the prices are steep, but I guess it goes with the class of hotel the restaurant is located in.In spite of this, it was a great dinner experience and we would eat there again!",2
"üôè Namaste, went for having lunch with family üë™ and loved their food and ambience. Thanks to all the attending waiters and explaining the history of recipe which we have choosen and those belongs to signature menu. Also surprised to know some of their menu and recipes are originated from Uzbekistanüá∫üáø. Only difficult part of the restaurant is no close by washroom for which we need to go out of the restaurant.Another new experience is that we will not be provided any spoon and fork and will have to eat by own hand to maintain taste probably and also to maintain traditions I guess.Overall it's a very good experience indeed in terms of food quality and and service and ambience. üôèüôèFood & drinks: Good.",2
"The place is very close to the airport. So conveniently fitted in on our last day in Mumbai.An very authentic tandoor experience. We were not given any utensils, even the black bean dal (which is to die for here, so good), we had to use our hands.Portion sizes are large, and a bit on the heavy side. So you‚Äôll likely end the meal feeling like you can‚Äôt walk. But worth it.",2
"One of the beautiful restaurants in ITC Maratha. Usually for guest dine in. We went there for our stay in ITC and we had Breakfast and Dinner there.Look wise the restaurant is spectacular and hospitality is good too and if I talk about food they usually serve Indian and continental and the taste was really good.Indian cuisine offered was really delicious and we really liked the dinner menu there though it wasn't offering more varieties in the menu as compared to the other 5 stars hotel and if I talk about the Breakfast, the menu was limited and few of the things we didn't like but overall it was not that bad.At last we had a nice stay there with good food.",2
"I was a little underwhelmed by the breakfast selection at this place, particularly given the price point. However, I must say that the pancakes with maple syrup were delicious, and the omelette was a real treat. The ambience of the restaurant was stunning, which added to the overall experience. They had a wide variety of tea cakes to choose from. They also had diverse range of Indian dishes, including dosa, idli, chole bhature, sabudana khichdi, aalo paratha etc. On the downside, the bacon was a disappointment as it was overcooked and difficult to chew. Nevertheless, the staff were incredibly polite and accommodating.",1
"The food in the hotel is sooo yummy, my family and I truly enjoyed it! The rooms are brilliant too and you are provided with almost everything you could ask for. The staff is really friendly too and there are so many cool things in the hotel lobby. I remember visiting the chocolaterie with my cousins, and it was so much fun! I would really enjoy coming back here once again.",2
"That's just your perception and ""haw"" is just an imaginary reaction.Next time when you are in India, I would request you to stop having food only on tapri or road side restaurants.Please try dosa in Peshwa Pavilion in Mumbai or Spice Kitchen,",2
Stayed at ITC Delhi but didn‚Äôt manage to book a seat at this restaurant.  But quite lucky at Mumbai- there was a table available for an early walk-in.  Single signature dish set - still too much for me. But the food tasted quite nice.  Mutton and chicken are well cooked with typical Indian flavour.  Definitely recommended especially if you stay at. ITC.,2
"ITC MarathaPeshwa Pavilion‚Ä¢ Breakfast- On Live order they offer : choice of eggs, South Indian cuisines (Dosa, Uttapa)- On counter they have wide options in bakery, continental, Asian and indian cuisines,- Fresh fruits & juices- Hot & cold beverages (tea, coffee)Good Experience,Live counters are covered and serving staff serves you with maintained social distancing,You may feel slow service but due to covid precautions you have to keep patience,‚Ä¢ DinnerWe ordered in all option and highlight was- mutton gravy & naan,- fried rice & noodles with gravyRank them one of the best restaurant with cleanliness, covered crockery & best on table serving and service,If you are celebrating any special occasion then they will make it as one of the finest memory,Recommended : Family & CouplesGreat Ambiance with Wonderful Hospitality",2
"Our expereince at Peshwa Pavilion was excellent, The buffet spread was so very yummy and the variety was so much that it was difficult not to leave any food item without tasting it.The ambience and atmosphere inside the restaurant was so warm and felt like home.Thank you once again for the hospitality, the food and for the attention given to us. It made us feel so special",2
"The starters were pretty good the seekh was a bit too over spiced barrah was very tender but too greasy.The mains were average to poor. The dal Bukhara had lots of butter but not much else . The murgh makhanwala had a very coarse textured sauce , I could not taste cashew in the gravy and had not been simmered in gravy enough just  wasn't tender enough.Service was worse than the food though everything took too long. My second tandoori bread took far too long and by the time it arrived all other food was ice cold .I skipped dessert because did not want to be disappointed further. I've eaten at Peshawari before in Chennai but this was disappointing, will take me long to return.",0
"The ambiance is too good. Food is the best. This is the only restaurant which serves the cutlery and plates in seal pack eco friendly packaging envelope in pandemic. Today we went for dinner with family n the food is as always the best the kababs were tasty. The Delhi chaat section was the highlight of the evening even server requested to try the sharbat which name the mohobbat ka sharbat üòç n no doubt it was refreshing n different . Do try Mutton n chicken Dum  Biryani with mirchi ka salan.  Now coming to the dessert which has lots of variety but  the indian sweets win the heart that besan laddus n hot piping imratis are the best. Mac n cheese is perfect. Breakfast was always lovely. Staff is helpful, hardworking and courteous . On special request they even made delicious dessert and kids meal.  Would like to visit again.",2
"A speciality northwest frontier restaurant where eating with fingers is encouraged. Seating is.on stools and benches, with arrangement being a little cramped. Waitermovement is disturbing ing. Food is superlative, including the breads. We ordered a rain, dal bhukkara, pudding parathas and butter naans.",2
This is definitely a must-have place to visit for Dal Bukhara dish. One of the best place in Mumbai,2
The food was divine. The ambience was awesome. The tandoor roti was special as it is so big and is meant to be shared within 2 or more people. The unique thing about this restaurant is that the kitchen is covered by glass. So we can actually see them cooking behind the glass. The service is awesome. It has to be for the price they are charging. The staff is very kind and helpful. Overall a very good experience.,2
"If you like anything iced, be aware that it comes out of a container on the floor with a lid that is regularly dropped on the floor (photo attached).We left the airport to go to Peshawri on a long layover because of the recommendation of a friend. The food is outstanding, the service is abysmal. You can see the back of house staff working in a hot kitchen pretty consistently throughout the night, but expect your server to be inconsistent as well as completely disappear throughout the meal‚Ä¶ if seated at front, you may even assist in the game of flagging servers down to request service for yourself or acknowledgement for the folks walking around looking for help in getting seated.Walkability: Not walkable, not safe. Recommend using a car to get anywhere in Mumbai.Food & drinks: Service is terrible, cleanliness questionable, food is delicious.",0
"Went to the restaurant to celebrate a special occasion, was really impressed with the service especially since the restaurant was fully booked.Ninad at front of the service made a great impression with him making extra efforts to ensure we had a great evening.Sushan got us a complimentary cake to celebrate and we appreciated the above and beyond efforts of the team.The starters / kebabs are their signature item which were all great special mention to the Rann and prawns. The dal makhani was amazing and lived up to the high expectations.Desserts although not disappointing were the weakest of the 3 courses.Overall great food and amazing service made the experience memorable.",2
"The menu is very thoughtfully selected by the management. At many places, lot of dishes are added to a brunch just to add to the count and after trying them one feels they were better skipped. At Peshwa Pavilion, not one dish seemed to be out of place. Even the minute details like chutneys and papads were top notch. We thoroughly enjoyed everything, the seafood section needs a special mention - baby lobster, Bombay duck, prawns, variety of fish, octopus, sushi! The dessert section was also phenomenal. Lost count of how many servings we took of the jalebi rabdi. Even the pastries and eclairs was amazing. All and all a definite 5 star rating for the experience!!",2
"Best Indian food one can imagine. Five stars for quality of food, service and ambience.Best place to take your distinguished guests or to give a very memorable treat to your family / friends. Though it is quite expensive but is wort every rupee.A foreigner guest would remember this event for ever.The kababs are prepared with great love and care so also other Indian foods",2
"I visited India after years and was whisked off to Peshawari by friends straight from the airport because apparently this was the place to be and it‚Äôs difficult to get reservations. After 17hr long flight, I was looking forward to this dining experience, literally speaking.The following sums up my experience-Fancy cocktail names, all taste like rasna with no or little alcohol (needless to say, cost when converted to $ was expensive compared to far better cocktails I get back at home) .. totally avoidable.Set menu will not be served to a table of more than one person even if every one wants to order their own set menu and not share it, no clear reason why, apparently set menu was only if a person was dining alone and sitting alone at the table - unreal and weird! Service was the worst ever, extremely understaffed. We had to go and ask for help every single time and I was met with frown every time. Food is good but there almost a non existent vegetarian menu. Dal tasted good.Clearly not a five start hotel worthy.",0
"The expectations set by the great ambience didn't translate into the taste of food.
The choices ib the buffet were limited and
we left with an unsatisfied appetite...",1
Amazing food. Service initially not great but it improved. Overall a decent experience. Highly recommend their lamb leg,2
"I went to Peshawari only for Dal Bhukara. Rest of the dishes were just add on. The menu is limited but the all the dishes are really delicious. For starters we ordered veg. Seekh kebab and Tandoori aloo. The seekh kebab was one of the best I‚Äôve had. For the main course we ordered dal bhukara (obviously) and paneer Kadak, both were absolutely delicious. Overall, ambience and service is great. The only thing that has a room for improvement was roomali roti.",2
A very nice buffet restaurent but you can also order Ala carte. Very few choices of whiskeys they have .,2
"Went for a team lunch here. We were three of us, and we each had the single person menu. The seating arrangements are good, tables are well separated from each other. The quantity is really good, it's quite impossible for one person to actually finish the single person menu. Regd the food, the dal bukhara was indeed amongst the best i have ever had. There were a bunch of starters, some great, some OK. Similarly, the flatbread (laccha paratha, naan) were good, but paneer makhani was OK. Among desserts, gulab jamun was amazing (very freshly made), kulfi, rabdi etc were good but not great.Overall, tough to say it was worth it, cos it's really expensive. Maybe, go once just to try it out?",2
Great place nice ambience. Had a breakfast buffet. Great variety of food. Loved the loved counter of dosa and eggs. The food was great and served hot. Proper prescriptions and safety measures were taken care of. It was satisfying. Planning to visit again.,2
Such a delightful experience. The food is divine and cooked to perfection. Love that they ‚Äòrecommended using our fingers‚Äô to eat and provide aprons so you can be as messy as you like. Such a. Great concept and fun way to enjoy Indian cuisine,2
"Had come here for a special occasion breakfast. Food was decent, nothing spectacular in a buffet. Service was very poor though, the servers were scrambling around for orders not sure which table had ordered what, took very long for our specials to come. Lost the charm somewhat wrt buffet. Will try a la carte at other restraunts",1
"Today I visited the great ""Peshawri"" at ITC Maratha. They have a specially designed Single Menu which starts with roasted papad, spicy green mint chutney and lachha onion sprinkled with house special chat masala, and green chillies.Tandoori starters - creamy paneer sprinkled with pudina, flavourful veg seekh kebab, bharwan aloo - potato jackets stuffed with spicy mixture of potato and dry fruits, roasted pineapple, roasted capsicum and onions with a side of green salad.serve paneer butter masala and pudina paratha with their world famous Dal Bukhara - a heady mix of creamy thick daal and lentils slow cooked for over 20 hours in a large vessel (deg).creamy and thick phirni made by cooking rice with saffron and milk topped with ground pista.",2
"Located inside ITC Maratha, this is one restaurant known for their yummy Dal Bukhara and a luxury dining experience. The seating is comfortable with large wooden tables and benches. Service staff is well mannered and very knowledgeable. The pricing is a bit on the expensive side.We opted for a vegetarian & a non vegetarian set three course menu consisting of starters, mains and desserts.The vegetarian starters consisted of Tandoori Aloo, Tandoori Salad & Subz Seekh. Decent in terms of flavour, but we didn't find this extra ordinary, unlike the non vegetarian starters, Murgh Malai Kebab, Reshmi Kebab & Peshawri Kebab, which were truly mouth watering. All of them were tender and moist, the balance of flavours was outstanding and the quantity was great too..üòçThe main course was Paneer Makhni for vegetarian menu & Murgh Makhni for the non vegetarian and Dal Bukhara in both served with a choice of Indian Bread. Dal Bukhara was simply too good and something one wishes to have more of..üòãFor dessert we requested for Kulfi & Rabdi. Both were delicious and were the perfect end to such a lovely meal. We also had Watermelon juice and Sweet Lime Soda to help gulp down the food.",2
Hi Guy's .if any one want to give party to your family or friends at peshawri .ITC Maratha than u must visit one's nd feel how much taste food they serve nd the hospitality they serve to there guests is osm really no words to describe..the restaurant infrastructure is beautiful u feel different...so come with family or friends nd feel the pleasure...,2
"Great north western Indian food with wonderful serviceHighly recommended. Nice ambiance with authentic decor. Service is marvelous. Food is having extra ordinary taste & flavors. Limited Veg menu for starters. Staying nearby we visited again this excellent spot for experiencing succulent Peshwari cuisine. We had a platter of Murgh khurchan and Dal , food was cooked and prepared to perfection. The breads were equally good also.",1
"One of the best places. Their courtesy, the warmth, the food and the service. Top notchAmbience: it gives you a feel of a cozy Afghani place with decorated walls with rugs and brass platesService: prompt and courteousFood: it's foodg√†smic level. The dal makhani, i never tasted anything like that and the mutton, it was melting in my mouth. Infact my dad is old and can't chew hard on meat but he loved the soft tender meat at peshawari's.I accept their prices are over the top. But i think to maintain that level of finesse, they require this",2
Ambiance and the vibes of the place is vey good.it‚Äôs a luxurious place.food is delicious and the service is quick and very heart warming.In this era of pandemic they are doing there best to sanitised the cutlery and plates.,2
"Food was really good. But service here was really bad not even glass for water  given for about first 15-20 mins. No one came to take our order for another 10 mins. Service here is too slow. No body is there to take care what u need .Ambience is really beautiful though. Spacious enough so that you go by your business. nice quiet ,cozy, upscale place . Food is tasty . Hygeine is good. But service is really bad. The upset of the peshwa pavilion. I was disappointed ITC Maratha has such a bad service.Vegetarian options: Not so much option in vegetarian .but Veg people don't have to worry about it. Sufficient enough to enjoy meal",1
"A nice place for good quality of food along with the ambient. We went for one party and enjoying a lot.
The hospitality of all the employees also wonderfully.",2
Yesterday I visited this restaurant for dinner with friends . We were 8 of us and prebooked the table !  It was the worst hospitality experience for us ! The person was not interested in any order . We booked the table for 10 pm but they gave us table at 10.45 pm and he rudely said you need to give all order in one go .. starters main course everything . When I asked about the menu he replied that scan the QR code but there was no network so asked him to help us which he was little furious.   Even for   spoon and fork we had to request them again and again They don't have jain option not interest to make ( don't know about the chef but the person who was serving us )  and veg options were limited .. after some starters and lassi we had to shift to another restaurant in ITC .Worst experience üò™..He spoiled our celebrationsVegetarian options: Not much options,0
"If you crave for Bukhara‚Äôs spectacular food then Peshawri can be a close second-best option. Kick-start the evening with a smorgasbord of appetizers. Pair your drink with, tandoori jhinga, paneer tikka, murgh malai kabab, kadak seekh, tandoori aloo, barrah kabab, marrel fish tikka, bharwan paneer and tandoori lobster. Take a naan peshawri or tandoori naan to polish off the curries. Definitely order, dal Bukhara, murgh makhani, paneer khurchan, murgh khurchan and paneer makhani.Food & drinks: Food was literally awesome and the service was quick. It is the place all are looking for a desirable vacation.",2
"The grandeur, the ambience and the food. you closely feel like being in a palace. I like the Pavilion more than the other restaurants at ITC due to its expance and openness. If you opt for a buffet they do have certain offers for 1 on 1 on Paytm and other apps, Regardless you're in for a treat. The bacon, the pork and the chicken. Absolutely lovely! If you've a sweet tooth you'll be spoiled with the sheer number of choices. Always start with the desserts! Cheers!",2
"a lovely place to spend time, but was disappointed with service standards. Went there after almost 20 years, brought back old memories.  Found it very dull. It's not lively as it used to be.",1
"If you have stayed in ITC Maratha, this restaurant can‚Äôt be missed. Situated in the atrium of the property, it is one the most beautiful restaurant where we have dined. Ambiance is excellent and service superb. The buffet restaurant serves breakfast for guests and also doubles up as coffee shop.Food is tasty in line with ITC culinary experience.",2
Tandoori Aloo was the best in the lot. Wonderful how they are trying to keep traditional dishes and ways of eating alive. Courteous staff and yummy dishes! 5 on 5! Only thing good remaining at ITC Maratha,2
So we had a kebab here... It is expensive but it's worth it... Panneer was so soft I never had paneer like this before... Same goes with aloo kebab it's different and it's nothing like I have ever taste it.... In aloo tandoori kebab they make outer of kebab from aloo itself and they specially order paneer from Delhi... They also explained everything how they made which make service here even more better,2

Excellent food. Courteous staff. Abundunt options to choose from the buffet.,2
"It is an expensive place to be! Dishes here be it starters or main course, nothing is less than 2.3k/dish. The food is tasty. We ordered peshawari kabab which is mutton - perfectly made, kasturi kabab- chicken, daal Bukhara, stuffed naan, khasta naan and pudina paratha. All the 3 types of bread were very hard. One expects a roti/naan to be soft and edible.. they were like papad.The seats are not very comfortable as there is no back rest. They need to do something about it.",1
"Luxurious property, near to Airport, Rooms are spacious, bathroom is clean, toiletries are ok ok since they use ITC product itself, Breakfast and dinner Buffet is lavish",2
We went to ITC Maratha - Peshawri for dinner..We specifically went there to eat dal Bukhara..so we ordered dal Bukhara and some different different breads ...We were instructed that please enjoy the food in traditional style i.e. eat your food with your hands not with spoon and fork..Eating food in traditional style also give you a different feel and taste...And Dal Bukhara was ambrosial... You can feel the taste of butter in every bite...Staff is very polite and friendly..üòä,2

"We went to celebrate our anniversary in Peshwa Pavilion as we absolutely love the spread there. The food and ambience were just perfect as usual. Prompt service and super attentive staff are their forte. Chef Shyamal Kumar ensured that our day was made extra special in every which way. Thank you Chef for everything!!! The manager Mr. Ramkrishna was around all through to check if we were comfortable and were enjoying ourselves. The cake was absolutely lip smacking! A must, must visit place to celebrate all your special occasions and also whenever you want to be pampered.Vegetarian options: A good variety of vegetarian options are easily availableParking: They have valet parking.Kid-friendliness: The food is kid friendly, the staffs ensure the kids are well fed and taken care of.",2
Absolutely out of this world amazing food. Probably one of the best Indian food restaurants I have been to on the planet. Situated within the ITC Maharata hotel makes it feel like a palace setting providing a great ambience and supplemented by amazing service makes for a great meal. 100% recommend a visit here. Will be back soon.,2
"If you're looking for the ultimate luxury experience, look no further than this incredible 5-star hotel. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted by a team of friendly and attentive staff who are dedicated to making your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.When it comes to dining, the hotel has an array of options to suit all tastes. Whether you're in the mood for a casual meal or a fine dining experience, the chefs here are truly talented and always deliver exceptional food. And if you're in the mood for a drink, the hotel bar is the perfect place to relax and unwind with a delicious cocktail or glass of wine.But what really sets this hotel apart is the incredible level of service. The staff go above and beyond to ensure that every guest feels welcome and taken care of. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, everyone is friendly, professional, and eager to make your stay as memorable as possible.Overall, I can't recommend this 5-star hotel enough. If you're looking for a luxurious and unforgettable experience, you won't be disappointed.",2
5 stars for this 5 star.The staff was really friendly. Manager also suggested cuisine. Must try is there Dal Makhani which is out of this universe. The dining experience was overall very good. Just the ambience was crowded even on weekdays and a lot of noise (due to customers) Rest the experience was amazing..Costing is about 5k for 2 people. Try to get zomato gold or other dining options for better deals.,2
I really enjoyed the traditional style food. The kebabs are yummy. The bukhara dal is as close to what you get from Bukhara in ITC Maurya. Gulab Jamun was also good.,2
"You can taste the authentic Indian dishes with affordable prices. Peshawri is a great restaurant inside ITC hotel. Very luxurios as it seems but I swear, it is very affordable. The food is worth it of what you paid for.Great service by the resto's staff and the chef is very friendly.The place is super duper clean and high class.I honestly enjoyed the food/dishes in Peshwari and would highly recommend it.",2
Oosone authentic taste,2
By far one of the best restaurants for kebabs and north Indian cuisine! Expensive but completely worth it!! The sikandari Raan and Dal Bukhara are to die for!!,2
"Good ambience. Good food. But expensive

Vegetarian options: Good variety of vegetrain food available",2
"Delicious food, Great atmosphere & ambience
More importantly very skillful & courteous staff.",2
"Beautiful stay. The staff was so supportive and always helpful. They make you feel super at home, which is why this is one of my favorite hotels to stay in. Comfortable beds. Beautiful views. Kind and polite staff. Awesome food. Your platform has also been super helpful with discounts and rates. Special kudos to your team.",2
Great Indian food but quite expensive. Be ready to go old school by eating with your hands.,2
"I have been here for 3 days the facilities were awesome , the management was so good .Mouthwatering food üëåLocation is just perfect.Room interiors grabbed my attention ...üòòWalkability: Enough space..",2
Best food best view with the best hospitality service . All the staff members are very nice . Best rooms with proper hygiene and with proper maintanence. Loved this hotel alot and their food is too amazing as well . Loved the Chinese dishes as well.,2
The staff was over stressed and not managing the bookings properly. The sitting was not comfortable at all. The kababs were really good but the murgh makhani was nothing special. I would say rumali roti was good nice and thin. Not worth the money.,0
"Call for food for my daughter's birthday just after lockdown is opening..The order was taken courteously and arrived on specified time, properly packed to keep the taste and look of the food as it would have been when served in tge restaurant itself..Felt so heavenly to have the Peshawari food after  6 months.",2
"Food excellent, service confusing, menu confusing on top complimentary drinks were charged in the bill....
Overall felt really missed out on great experience",1
"The food here is out of the world. Right from the Paneer Gravy to Rotis. We especially indulged in the Dal Bukhara and Ras Malai. The Dal Bukhara is one of their most famous signature dish, a must have. RAS malai was so melt in your mouth soft. The service was excellent. They have put moveable glass privacy shields in-between all tables which we found to be very good. The plate, bibs, water bottle, glass were sealed/packed with sanitation message. This is a great place to enjoy a mughlai meal. Even after a gap of 15 years since I had their Dal Bukhara it's still the same. We also added naan amaal, pudina paratha and Roomali roti all made of whole wheat flour.",2
It's an amazing place with very good food options. I loved the veg platter.,2
"I visited the restaurant for dining and it was awesome and felt  fantastic experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by  hostess and seated me to the dining table .

"Amazing place with great ambience and if you want an authentic Peshawri Cuisine, it's a must visit, the Sikandari Raan is by far the best Non Vegetarian Cuisine I have ever had, the real mix of spices and aroma and the Peshawri feel when you have to eat it with your hands really takes you back to historic times, infact the ambience is also royal, well that's something ITC is known for.",2
We stayed here last month vocation. Such a nice spot to get peace and happiness. Rooms are top class and very hygiene environment.  Everything we saw there was very trendy and beautiful. Very fabulous outlet. Really it was nice treat to our eyes.If you want to stay in around here.

Great veg and non veg food. You can see the food preparation with the tandoori,2
I recently visited ITC grand maratha with family. I was impressed by the service and hospitality they offered. We were welcomed with drinks and the food was very tasty and delicious. The food was decorated nicely that I could resist posting it. The atmosphere was no less than a Royal place. The interiors of the hotel was so good and air was having nice scent..! Overall I loved dining at the hotel,2
"""I recently had the pleasure of staying here, and I must say it was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. From the moment I arrived, the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed. The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with a comfortable bed and all the amenities I could ask for.One thing that really stood out to me was the hotel's attention to detail. Every aspect of the hotel, from the lobby to the restaurant to the guest rooms, was beautifully designed and impeccably maintained. I also appreciated the little touches, like the fresh flowers in the room and the complimentary snacks and drinks.The hotel's location was also ideal, with easy access to all the attractions I wanted to visit. And when I needed recommendations for restaurants and activities, the staff was more than happy to provide their expert advice.Overall, I can't recommend [hotel name] highly enough. If you're looking for a luxurious and memorable hotel experience, this is the place to be.""",2
"I like this place for the quality of service as well as the food.While they don't have a large menu or lots of food varieties, but whatever they make, they do it well.Dal makhni or slow cooked Black Lentils is the signature dish and a must have.",2
"I recently dined at ITC Peshwari and was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the food. The menu had a great variety of dishes to choose from, and each dish was expertly prepared and full of flavor.The service was top-notch, with the wait staff being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They made great recommendations and ensured that the dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.The presentation of the food was beautiful, with each dish being thoughtfully arranged on the plate.

"visited on the 2nd august for dinner buffet at the table number 50.Service : no longer with a smile or efficiency , deterioration was visible.Food : ok but indeed can be better .Deserts : below par .I paid in excess of 14 K but no bill was produced in hard copy . I was told by the floor manager , who noted my mobile number , that it will be sent by whatsapp but till date not sent . Quite not like ITC .Overall : the good old days at the Peshwa Pavilion seem over",1
"I had the pleasure of staying at ITC for a week and what an amazing experience it was! The staff were so friendly and helpful, and made me feel right at home. The rooms were luxurious and comfortable, with all the amenities you need for a perfect stay. Not to mention the beautiful view of the surroundings! I would highly recommend ITC to anyone looking for a relaxing & luxurious stay.",2
"The food was awesome. I wanted to taste Peshwa style cuisine so I ordered basundi and mohan pedha.The ambiance is excellent and the interiors give a look of Shaniwar Wada of the Peshwas. I really felt at home due to the excellent service. Another thing to note, which is not good is that there is no picture of any of the Peshwas out there. You will not find any Peshwa history right from Bajirao 1 to Vishwasrao, Nanasaheb to Sadashivrao, Madhavrao to Baji Rao 2. Even the valiant Chimaji Appa is not mentioned anywhere.The manager told me that they have the paintings in the stock but don't have place to put them. I guess they should really work on that. Otherwise, everything is wonderful!",2
"This Restaurant is an absolute gem for lovers of authentic Marathi cuisine.The moment you step inside, you're greeted with warm hospitality and a vibrant ambiance that reflects the rich cultural heritage of Maharashtra.The menu is a delightful exploration of traditional Marathi flavors, with dishes that are packed with delicious spices and aromatic ingredients.The food is cooked to perfection, delivering a burst of flavors with every bite.",2

"Mostly we can feel it as our home  rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing and hygienic place . They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting downtown. 24/7 service available and good maintenance nice furniture attractive designs and good looking to stay here.",2
"The meal at the hotel is quite delicious; my family and I both really loved it! In addition to being fantastic, the rooms come with practically everything you could possibly need. There are many of unique items in the hotel foyer, and the staff is also quite kind. It was so much pleasure going to the chocolaterie with my cousins, I remember. I would love to visit this place once more.",2
"Love the evening buffet, really good spread esp got someone who loves salads, great choice of Indian and dessert.",2
The ambience there is awesome.. Variety of food available.. I liked it very much..,2
"We particularly enjoyed the atmosphere, which was more informal than expected. Rajendra came to the table to take our order himself. He has a really lovely character and made us felt at ease and respected. This is reflected in his staff as well, who are incredibly professional and clearly take pride in their work while remaining verypersonable.A fantastic experience, and highly recommended!",2
"Love love the food, courteous staff, hate the seating. It's probably the sloth in me that needs seating (especially at a restaurant) with a back rest.Their tables either seat two or six, the six seater has back rests and a couch, the couple tables have these weird toadstools to sit on and the tables look like tree stumps.I would definitely recommend that they rethink their seating as it's not comfortable at all, specially when the patrons really want to relax and enjoy the amazing food that the restaurant offers.The daal bhukhara is hands down a winner, my serious suggestion - get two bowls of it straight off because that will get polished off the quickest!A special mention of the staffs' uniforms, I love the fact that the management kept the uniforms and the servers foot wear in tune with the resturant theme.",2
"The atmosphere of the restaurant was also pleasant. It had a cozy and intimate feel, with soft lighting and comfortable seating. However, the noise level was a bit high, which made it difficult to have a conversation without raising our voices.",2
"The food in the lodging is sooo yummy, my family and I really appreciated it! The rooms are splendid as well and you are given nearly all that you could want. The staff is truly cordial as well and there are such countless cool things in the inn entryway. I visited the chocolaterie with my cousins, and it was such a lot of tomfoolery! I would truly appreciate returning here by and by.",2
starters there was cold which clearly indicates the food is not fresh. my overall experience is that the taste is nothing great so is the food,1

"When we think about celebrations, Peshawai ITC is always our first option and it never disappoints. From the starter to the dessert the quality and tastes of everything was outstanding, my favourite Chicken nan & kabab all  might have been the best meal I have ever been served. Service was delightful and very professional. 10/10",2

"Peshawri at the ITC Maratha is an exceptional dining experience that transports you to the heart of the North-West Frontier. The ambience is rustic and intimate, with traditional decor and warm lighting creating an inviting atmosphere.The star of the show, however, is the food. The menu is a celebration of the robust flavors and unique cooking techniques of the Peshawar region, with dishes like the iconic Dal Bukhara and the tender and flavorful Raan-e-Peshawri taking center stage.Each dish is cooked to perfection, with the use of authentic ingredients and spices elevating the flavors to new heights.

"Excellent hospitalityWe stayed here for two Days , our stay was very nice, just fantastic. Rooms was Clean and Spacious with all available services. we had a royal experience, food quality was good. nice place to stay. highly recommended.",2
"Peshawri at ITC Maratha is a must-visit for any food lover in Mumbai. The authentic North Indian cuisine is simply exceptional, especially the succulent kebabs and rich curries. The elegant ambience and attentive service add to the overall experience, making it a perfect place for a special occasion or a romantic dinner.",2
"""A HOME AWAY FROM HOME""- Yeah! Exactly the right phrase to describe my stay at this colossal place with such a beautiful vibe full of positivity and energy. Everything was spot on from the room service to the food, the staff and the management. This place will be the cherry on top of your vacation. TRULY REMARKABLE!",2
"Had been once to Peshawari prior to this visit of mine. And every single time I have just simply loved their food. Located on lobby level of ITC Maratha, Andheri East the USP of this place is to have your food with hands and it tastes divine.I visited Peshawari on a special occasion, my birthday and it was indeed a treat. Ofcourse it was just a week prior that restaurants were allowed to invite guests for dine-in, so lucky me. If you happen to visit the restaurant now, they have big glass partitions to every table so you get your own private space. They have taken a lot of care in terms of hygiene, so utensils are washed, sanitized via UV and packed before being placed on the table so no human has touched the plate before you. Also there is no menu now so you get a digital menu which you scan on the table and check for yourself.On welcome we were treated with a papad platter and green chutney, chutney is superb. Peshawari offers 3 different options in its menu - you can go A-la-carte, Signature Set Menu or Single Diner's Experience Menu. Let me warn you the quantity offered by Peshawari is huge portions. So go for Signature Set Menu only if you have a huge appetite else you may need to pack a lot of food and take it back. Set Menu is priced at 4000 and taxes. We were 2 of us, so we decided the best option for us would be to go for 2 single Diner's Experience Menu. This was priced at 2375 and taxes. It's a 3 course meal with Starters, Main Course and Dessert.This menu comes with 2 pieces of Tandoori Aloo, 1 piece of Subz Seekh and Tandoori Salad as starters. For mains - it's Paneer Makhani and their signature Dal Bukhara. The mains are absolutely divine. Must haves here. You can choose your bread along with the mains. We called for Butter Naan and Cheese Naan. Cheese Naan is super filling I must say. And for dessert you get an option to choose any one from Gulab Jamun, Ras Malai, Kulfi and Phirni. We tried the Gulab Jamun and Kulfi with Falooda, again superb!We had a splendid time at Peshawari, the staff took really good care of us, a special mention for the manager - Mr. Hitesh, extremely helpful and courteous. Thank you Peshawari for making my special day even more special!",2
"My friends and I recently visited Peshwa Pavilion in Ashok Nagar, Andheri East, Mumbai and it was a delightful experience! The buffet spread was vast and the food was simply delicious. The ambiance of the restaurant was elegant and inviting, and the service was excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant for a fulfilling dining experience with friends and family.",2
"Without a doubt one of the great experiences at ITC Grand Maratha. Hospitality and food at its best. We had two great evenings here, which obviously also added up to the experience. such a quiet and peaceful environment.Food & drinks: Awesome",2
The best place to dine-in with friends and family. Delicious food with soothing atmosphere makes it more memorable place. Visit and once your heart will keep on wanting to come again and again. Rooms are quite spacious and well maintained. You will enjoy your day to the best.,2

Beat 5 start buffet in Mumbai.,2
I think there are better options around the city... Sorry ITC..Didnt expectvto spend 3.5 hrs for lunch.. Super slow servicd..,1
"The ambiance and service were top notch. I particularly liked the recommendations from service staff to use hands instead of cutlery to enjoy Peshawari food. It was my fast visit here and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Will definitely recommend it to my friends, colleagues and family",2
"We had this cousin reunion party watching India Vs England world Cup match.The vibe , ambience and atmosphere were all very electrifying. The food was not upto the mark.It was just about OK. The mocktails were slightly better. Staff was very courteous and helpful.Over all an Okayish experience .",1
The food was deliciousThe service is really goodThe dj was not that good and they start the good songs after 10 maybe but before that it was so boring and loudEven when asked for changing the music the dj put a very bad comment during the musicFor me I prefer the palladium Phoenix mall Hitchki really good vibes there and songs alsoBecause we like to enjoy the songs and the vibes with the delicious food,1
"A nice place to spend some time.. reasonable prices and good atmosphere.
Food is quite good.
I specially liked their elaborate menu of cocktails, they have something for everyone",2

"Had a wonderful experience at Hitchki... The food is just... AMAZING!!!! Also, the PORTION SIZE is so generous!! The place was crowded being a Saturday night but Service was so so soooo time.

The menu offered a delightful variety of dishes, each beautifully presented and bursting with flavor.I was particularly impressed by the quality of the ingredients used, which truly elevated each dish to a new level. The wine selection was also excellent, perfectly complementing our meal.",2
The drinks are awesome. Spider-Man drink is very good. Food is also good. We only had starters and drinks.,2
"We ordered one Veg Platter, 1 Non Veg Platter and Bus Kar Chicken. The food was average. Not too great. Ambience is good.
The best part was the Richie Rich mocktail.",2
"For starters, Hitchki definitely has the most unique names for their dishes. It‚Äôs so creative and fun to go through the entire menu. I ordered Harry pot rice and it was delicious. It was perfectly saucy, scrumptious and flavourful. Then, tried their Nasi goreng which was a bit dry but nonetheless delicious. Lastly, we ordered Kuch bhi which was actually a mushroom and cheese stuffed roll. Unfortunately, it isnt the best thing on their menu. The pancake layer on the outside was thick and unappetising. The filling was okayish. Anyway, this place is definitely worth a try for their unique names, fun way of serving dishes, and their friendly restaurant staff!!Vegetarian options: All the food that we ordered was veg and it was up to the mark",2
Went here with my colleagues for dinner. The place is always packed and we had to wait for some time until we got a place. The food here is quite conventional and quantity wise it's really good. They have great combos to feast on. They have a great ambience too with dim lights and great music on. Do go here if you are nearbyVegetarian options: Both veg and non vegKid-friendliness: Might not like to take kids,2
"We had visited around 6.30 and the place was moderately filled. Though a good turnout for a  weekday. However, service was slow and inconsistent. Food menu looks more interesting than it actually is. Disappointed with the food. Portions are extremely small. Taste not upto the mark",0
"Tasty and delicious food. Many items are similar to what you have in most places. But the momos are very tasty and unique. One of the very best I've had. The drinks are great too. Lively place.Edit: Forgot that I had been here more than 2 years ago. Been there today again. Surely one of the most on-demand restaurants. It was full on a Monday afternoon. Coming to the food, had some dumplings and tunday kebabs along with Ramen. Decent value for restaurants inside BKC. Hitchki's still got it and is going great guns.",2
Well totally enjoyed this place. We liked the ambience and the cordial staff serving us and helping us to chose the right dish to try.We had a Pav Bhaji burger and open Samosa. Food was very delicious and also unique at the same time.This place is also spacious enough. You can enjoy a good time with your friends and family. The menu is full of unique and interesting dishes to try.,2
"*The place is a tad small, but well maintained and sets the mood right* Veg options are good, we tried the Indian platter and we loved the variety and the quantity of the serving.* Very refreshing mocktails, will recommend the Minions.* The washrooms are spotless and very well maintained.* The DJ and music was really fun!* The staff is vigilant and the service is quick.",2

"Hichki truly stands out in terms of its impeccable food, convenient location near offices, and an impressive cocktail and mocktail menu.First and foremost, the food at Hichki is nothing short of exceptional. The menu offers a delightful fusion of flavors, with a wide variety of options to satisfy any palate. From mouthwatering appetizers to delectable main courses and heavenly desserts, every dish was a culinary masterpiece. The presentation and taste of the dishes were top-notch, making the dining experience truly memorable.The restaurant's strategic location in Bandra Kurla Complex is a boon for professionals working in the area. Its proximity to offices makes it an ideal choice for a quick lunch or a post-work gathering. The ambiance is both elegant and relaxed, providing a perfect setting for business meetings or casual get-togethers.What truly sets Hichki apart is its cocktail and mocktail menu. The bartenders are skilled in crafting creative and refreshing drinks that complement the food perfectly. Whether you prefer a classic cocktail or a unique mocktail, Hichki has something to offer for everyone.",2
"I would like to talk about the atmosphere and service of Hitchki. It was so classy and the ambience was so sober and calm.
You can try ""Main toh SuperHero"" mocktail in here. It was worth a time.",2
Nice place. In BKc. Food is excellent and atmosphere is a major hit.,2
Amazing place for a date. Good drinks and food. You can tell that the chefs pour their hearts out.Btw BEST NACHOS EVER.,2
Little loud for those who want to have a get together where they need to talk more. Great place for those who want to party. Almost every dish was just awesome in taste. Great variety of liquors. They have valet parking.,2
Happy Vibe is so strong that you can't sit at your place once the music starts. The interior and food is also good. Hanging out with your gang is mandatory if you are in BKC.,2
We were a group of 8 people meeting here to enjoy their food and each other's company. But there was a huge corporate group at the back that was being catered to. All the lights were switched off and the music was cranked up to night club levels. We had zero scope of hearing each other speak. This is not at all acceptable. When asked to switch on the lights. We were told that will not be possible. We were forced to identify and eat our food in cellphone flashlights.. That's not the ambience or the experience we wanted or paid for. The lack of other avenues to reach the management is also shocking! No emails or phone numbers we can reach out on. The management should be cognisent of ALL THE GUESTS at the restaurant and not just the big corporate group. It was a very disappointing night. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,0
"One of my favourite places to go but I honestly feel like the quality has degraded by 5% over the years. Was just looking for that extra kick in the food when I visited but didn't find it. The service and atmosphere was as always a 10/10. If you are visiting for the first time I'd definitely recommend the ""Humari Spring Mai Roll Hai"" and ""Tiger Zinga Hai"".",2
"I had a great experience with the two cocktails that I ordered Gin Martini with Pineapple and Tulsi along with the 'Dev-das' which is a version of LIIT. In the starters, chicken sheekh kebab and stir fried vegetables were really mouth-watering. The Konkani Fried Chicken was quiet and wasn't my personal favourite, especially the dip that comes with it was too sweet. The attendants were really polite. Overall a really good experience.Vegetarian options: Serves vegetarian really delicious starters.",2
"Entering this restaurant was like entering a gourmet paradise. An engaging dining experience was created by the ambiance, which skillfully combined homey warmth with modern style. Our taste buds were amazed by the meal, which was a magnificent voyage through a variety of flavours. Everything about the meal, from the appetisers to the main course, was expertly prepared and full of flavour combinations. The evening was transformed into a pleasant occasion rather than merely a meal thanks to the attentive staff's personal touch. The overall symphony of flavours and hospitality left a lasting impression, even though the dessert was a sweet crescendo. An amazing culinary adventure that guarantees to be remembered.",2
"I had a lovely experience here last night., the food and ambience is extremely good.Premium class service.Would definately recommend you guys to try it once. You all would love it",2
"Nice place to hangout with your friends and family. Ambience is superb.
Tasty food served with very unique and funny names.",2
"I had ordered an ""ek chutki sindoor"" cocktail. I didn't like it. Please don't go with the names. Ask for the ingredients that they put in which will make it easier for you to choose your own choice.",2
"Recently dined at Hitchki BKC and had a fantastic experience! The ambiance was vibrant, the service was top-notch, and the menu offered a delightful array of dishes. The cocktails were especially impressive, adding a creative touch to the overall dining experience. The staff was attentive and friendly, making sure we had a memorable time. Would highly recommend for a lively evening out!",2
"It is a very well known Resto-Bar which has 4 outlets in Mumbai and this is one of them, other's are located in Powai, Thane and R-City Mall, Ghatkoper. Hitchki has many facilities like Valet Parking, free Wi-Fi and everything in day time and DJ at night time. Also here are kid's not allowed after 6pm. In food here you can get North Indian, Modern Indian, Chinese, Continental etc. Ambience here is lovely with classy interiors.Moving to what all we had so we started with some Mocktail's and Cocktail's. In Cocktail's we ordered Foot long and Malta Mojito. And for Mocktail's we had Minions and Kuch Khatti kuch Meethi. All these were really very good in taste. Then is Starter's we had an Ulta Punjab, Fried Corn, full Zhol Che and French Fries. We really loved the Starter's. All were just fabulous in taste. Moving to Main course so in Main course we had Pindi Chole which was served with Kulcha. And we also had a Gratinated Dal Khichdi and Paneer ale Lababdaar, it was served with 2 Lachha Paratha's. Main course was also very tasty. Moving to dessert so in dessert's we tried Chocolate Lava Kulfi and Maharaja Tukda Return's. Dessert's were also perfect and very yummy in taste.Recommendation's ‚Äì Each n everything.Talking about service and presentation so service was very good and presentation of everything was really good.Overall we had an amazing experience here, we enjoyed alot.

"Great place. We went here with friends and kids. Ambience is great, food was good for us as well as kids. We ordered veg and non veg items. We had been there for lunch. Crowd was good - from corporate get together to family and friends meetings.We even ordered mocktails which were again great. Quantity and taste of food is good. Kids also enjoyed the food and place. Staff was good and their service was amazing. We had ordered veg crispy, french fries, cheeze naan, chicken lollipop, mutton gravy, chicken gravy with rotis, pindi chole with aaloo pyaaz kulcha, ice tea and few more mocktails. Overall I would rate them 5/5 for making our experience great.üòä",2
"Its a pretty chill place however as it doesn't take reservations for Friday and Saturday night, it's advisable to reach early and grab a table(8-8:30pm). DJ starts after 10pm. Do try the cosmo and nachos",2
"We had lunch at this place, first of all, one extra star for such a cool name.Located in Bandra Kurla complex. This is a good option for dine in.Place is well decorated. The vibe is really cool.They serve veg and non-veg food along with liquor.I recco this place for good non-veg food options, the veg  food is average.Mutton kebab and ghee roast rice are must try.Staff is polite and well behaved, the service though is a bit slow. We had to wait a lot for even a pint of bud to be served.Overall great experienceVegetarian options: They have good spread of veg options, however the taste is ok ok, nothing great.Parking: They offer valet parking so no hussle.Wheelchair accessibility: The place is not exactly disable friendly.",2
"Great food , good service , great place to go with friends ... bollywood theme is weaved in very well in all aspects of the experience. Slightly noisy I felt ...but that's my personal opinion not a deal breaker .Vegetarian options: Interestingly themed veg fusion dishes",2

It's all about the ambience. My first nightlife after hours experience in BKC. There's a huge queue and a entry pay to enter this place.You get a standing and overcrowded place with loud music with dancing on the floor wherever you're standing. Runs till about 1-2am.,2
"I didn't just like the food, I absolutely loved it! It's a great setting for dining with family or for chilling with friends. Versatile that way. It has a bar, but age restrictions are only during the evenings. Enjoyed most of the dishes here. Nice ambience. Oh and unique part: the menu. The dishes so wisely named. You'll enjoy just reading through the menu, it is such a fun read!",2
The staff are extremely friendly but have limited English. The restaurant is only open for breakfast and it is fine Japanese fare. The rooms are very small as in most Japanese hotel and there is no wardrobe so you have to store your clothes in your suitcase which in my case just about fits into my room,2

"Went on a weekday and it was crowded to the hilt.Abysmal seating - we were given bar stools to sit on which were uncomfortable to say the least. The quantity of food for the cost was a definite let down.The best part - no service charge at all (yes, it technically reflects on how expensive everything is. It's added into the price of the items). The service was the icing on the cake. Fast and always at your service.Will i visit again? Maybe when they have happy hours. Else, it's just too expensive.PS - Paid 18k for a group of 6 people (alcohol for 2 ppl)",1
"Visited with my bae yesterday night and it was packed. The staff was very helpful & look after us well & guess what, somehow arranged us a seat within 30 mins.

The DJ & music selection was good, once the lights are out people started dancing you'll for sure enjoy the vibes. Love this can‚Äôt get enough of it.

"In the corporate area like BKC, where restaurants enters and goes out of business in no time, the dearth of restaurants to fulfil the needs of elegant interior and place for corporate or group lunch/dinner remains.Turns out we got a restaurant which has studied the mistakes of previous restaurants and emerges itself with the smart interiors and dishes of people choice with some twists.On Saturday I got a chance to visit this place during lunch and I was impressed with the size of bar, seating options and the dark colour with wooden interiorsHitchki was on my go to list for the past few days, not only because of its eclectic menu but the never ending crowd this place has; either it‚Äôs lunch time or dinner,place is pack with spate of people doing conversations over drinks, ladies enjoying their kitty party and people in black suits having dinner over the meeting in nights.It offers variety of seating arrangements like long table and chair at the entrance in front of bars, tables from 2 to all the way 12/14 people and U shape sofa üõã sets for the families.üç∏MOCKTAILS TRIEDüçπ‚ñ™Ô∏èSNOW WHITEApple üçé Juice with the added flavour of cinnamon mixed with sugar syrup and soda topped with apple chunks.Drink was fizzy and the mild flavour of cinnamon moulds the taste of apple juice to new dimension and felt pleasing to the palettes.

"Hitchki BKC, one of the highest rated restaurants in Mumbai, absolutely lives up to it's billing. Right from the ambience to the service to the food, everything is awesome.The decor of the restaurant is fun and makes a good setting to enjoy the fare. The space is huge and they also have an open bar.The service is very good here, we were served by Sunil who was prompt and attentive.Coming to the food, they have so many options to choose from, it takes quite some time to decide. Whatever you order will not disappoint. Everything we tried was great.Mocktails:Richie Rich(Must Try)Snow WhiteMinionsPeach Iced TeaEach of these had their own unique flavour and were the perfect refreshing accompaniment to the food.Appetizers:Yeh to Hona hi tha:Pani Puri shaped fried pakodas filled with cheese and masala aloo. They are served with an imli chutney and a spicy shot of pani puri water. These were super fun to eat and tasted great.Nacho Nacho:Nachos topped with cheese, guacamole, beans and a salsa. They were served on a long plate, perfect for sharing. The nachos were crisp and were loaded with toppings. Absolutely loved it.Mains:Chettinad Chicken:Tamil Nadu style Chettinad Chicken served with laccha parathas. This was the best dish we tried. The gravy had great flavour and paired perfectly with the parathas, which were very well made. The chicken pieces were boneless to our surprise which was a nice bonus.Dessert:Khul jaa Sim Sim:Cheesecake topped with vanilla ice cream, Parle G biscuits and loads of caramel. This dish looked amazing and tasted just as good. It's wrapped in a Lion King paper which is opened at the table. Cheesecake stands out here, very rich. The ice cream pairs perfectly.I highly recommend this one. The prices are not as high as they usually are for a fancy BKC restaurant. Everything they serve is great!",2

Very very delicious food,  may it be the starters or the main course or the desserts. The DJ played music which didn't let me sit for a moment. My feet couldn't stop with the kind of mash up music. Talking about the service, unbelievably it was very quick and even though the entire place was jam packed, the service guys took care of us till we left. Overall an amazing experience. I will highly recommend it to all who live in Mumbai & who visit Mumbai.",2

Now days it feels so nice that Indian cuisine is really modernised in which they use special ingredients, service style and garnishes all are modernised compare with old days.(4.5/5)ÔÇß	Quick Ratings-‚Ä¢	Location- 4.5/5‚Ä¢	Theme- 4/5‚Ä¢	Food and Beverage- 4.5/5‚Ä¢	Service-5/5‚Ä¢	Value for Money- 4.5/5ÔÇß	To sum up- Within no time this restaurant chain has become popular and I won‚Äôt be surprised as I saw and experienced their total hospitality.

Again a drink to be shared in a group not for Solo person.‚Ä¢Dum Maro Dum-Vodka based drink, contains a mix of Cranberry & Pineapple. Impressive Presentation in tall glasses.**Starters:Yeh Toh Hona Hi Tha -It's for all Pani Puri lovers..it was a great variety which I never thought it could b served Pani Puri in a unique way. It consists of Pani Puri Pakoda, Panko Crumbed Puri, Masala Aloo Stuffed, Golden Fried.PS: must try out these unique dish‚Ä¢Ulta Punjab -It consist of Karari Roti, chilli oil, sev, cheese, chaat masala.

"So my next destination was Hitchki !One of the most renowned place at BKCVery easy to locate via Google Maps.They also give valet services for car parking (which i came to know later after i parked my vehicle at pay n park )Starting with the Ambience:A pretty beautiful ambience with nice interiors decorated and maintained well clean and fresh.Staff was pretty humble and tried to give their best hospitalityDishes I tried :""Mocktails""-> Lemon Ice Tea - Everyone knows this refreshing drink. Here also i tried the most basic drink and i felt this was little average. It lacked that taste and chatpata mint flavour which mostly lemon ice tea has.-> Riche Rich - Perfect drink to try in mocktails. Made with guava juice, strawberry and sweet lime it tasted perfect but it contained a bit guava juice more then other flavour. But it was tasty and nicely presented and served chilled-> Minions - The name is cute to hear and the drink is sweet to taste. I felt the taste was more kind of musk melon. It contained watermelon and guava juice which mixed and tasted like musk melon. It was presented nicely in a glass with a watermelon piece on it.""Starters""-> Crispy Chicken Khurrana - Quite dangerous name but great to taste. Presented in a Mug with around 8 pieces of chicken balls served with coriander chutney, it tasted delicious with perfect blend of spices in it. I felt a salt bit less. And it wont taste good if didn't served hot.->Bhut Jolokia Wings and Rings - This dish hade some 5 chicken wings made with bhut Jolokia sauce and with crispy Onion Rings with the wings. At start was sweet to taste and later it turns out to be spicy. The presentation was looking good and the taste was also perfect due to the spices used in the wings.""Main Course""-> Chow Mein - In Chow Mein there are various options to try from i.e Veg, Chicken or Egg. They also gives an option of Fried Rice or Noodles. They also serves 3 types of gravy in these options.I tried Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Chilly Garlic Gravy. The Fried rice were delicious but as they are quite common there isnt much to review in fried rice. They need to improve the quantity a bit in this dish.-> Paneer Lasagne RataToutille - It had 3 thick sheets of Paneer containing Kadai Sabzi in between the sheets served with hot cheese garlic naan. The sheets of paneer were basic but the sabzi made it taste wonderful. The presentation was made to its best by the chef there and was worth trying.""Desserts""-> Baratiyo Ka Swagat - A Pan flavoured Dessert served along with Dutch Truffle and with candy floss. It was presented beautifully with truffle, candy floss, and pieces of hazelnut but the taste was not that good as expected. For those who love pan and dutch truffle they may go for this option but for those who dont like pan may not try this as it may ruin the taste of previous yummy food-> Hazelnut Creme Bru Le Le - Served in a plate having nutella and hazelnut creme with lots of hazelnuts sprinkled over it and with some pieces of torched sugar, this dessert is worth the taste and money. It didnt tasted much like nutella because of hazelnut but it was perfectly sweet and delicious!The service was bit slow as the dishes took time to prepare but the hospitality was great.Food - 4.5 / 5Service and hospitality - 4.7 / 5Ambience - 5 / 5",2
"Hitchki, Mumbai, though the reviews on Google are ok but the food is not good. It was spicy (Rajmata rice) and the rice was not fresh in taste. One of us ordered Goshtaba ( non-veg) that was nowhere near the actual dish and taste. The food and its taste is not worth the changes that you will pay. The pooris and aaloo subzi didn't even have the pinch of flavours and taste of Uttar Pradesh (as printed in the menu).I will never come here again.",0
"Hitchki üòç‚ù§üòãüçªHitchki is a very well known Resto-Bar which has 4 outlets in Mumbai. I had visited in the Powai outlet long time ago and loved everything there and I wanted to visit this outlet since a long time and finally I went here with my friend. It is a Bollywood themed Resto-Bar and here's menu is totally different than any other place, mostly all the names of dishes in menu contains a dialogue or a movie name. Here you can get soo many different varieties of dishes in North Indian, Modern Indian, Chinese, American, Continental etc. Also here is restricted entry in which kids and below 21 aren't allowed here after 6pm, below 6pm all Age people are allowed. So you can enjoy your lunch here with your family, friends etc.Coming to what all we had :-)~ Mocktail's1‚Ä¢ Masala Soda2‚Ä¢ Kuch Khatti Kuch MeethiBoth of these were very nice and refreshing and Tastewise they were Perfect.~ Starter's1‚Ä¢ Nacho Nacho ‚Äì In this there were boiled Rajma, Curd n all and it was topped with 2-3 type's of cheese. Tastewise it was amazing.2‚Ä¢ Hara Bhara Ka Baap ‚Äì These were basically Hara Bhara Kebab and it was served with Lonavala Chikki and was topped with Coriander. Tastewise was very nice.~ Main Course1‚Ä¢ Pressed CookerWala Rajma Chawal ‚Äì I always love North Indian food and especially when it comes to Rajma n Paneer. So I had to try this out and I did, and these were really fantastic in taste. They served this with curd, a papad and sliced onions. Loved it totally.2‚Ä¢ Paneer Ale Lababdaar ‚Äì This was very yummy as expected from the name, in this there were also some dry fruit's and in this there wasn't Paneer piece's but Paneer kofte type. Tastewise it was awesome.~ Dessert's1‚Ä¢ Khas Khas ka Halwa ‚Äì In it there was Khas khas halwa topped with caramelized nuts and served with vanilla ice-cream. Taste was amazing as usual.2‚Ä¢ Chocolate Lava Kulfi ‚Äì I'm sure you must have had Chocolava cake which every restaurant serves with vanilla ice-cream. But have you ever had ChocoLava cake with Malai Kulfi?? I'm sure your answer will be ""No"" if u haven't visited ""Hitchki"". It is totally an different combination which is available only in ""Hitchki"" and which is a must must must try. Because it is very difficult to find this at any other place.Talking about service and presentation so service was very good n quick and presentation of all the things was fabulous. Also the staff here is very nice and friendly.Recommendation's ‚Äì Each n Everything.‚ù§üòçOverall Rating's ‚ÄìQuantity - 5/5Quality - 5/5Taste - 5/5Value For Money - 5/5Service - 5/5Ambience - 5/5Staff - 5/5Cleanliness - 5/5Overall - 5/5Overall our experience here was just amazing.

"One of the favorite restaurant. I have visited the powai outlet & was super impressed by everything. Here also the menu is same but the entrance is pretty huge. Ambience is nice as always but it is equivalent to the powai outlet.I am a big fan of that group who have created this menu, superb creativity & talent. Their were few dish which was skipped during my first visit so i ordered that. List of food items - Chicken nachos, chicken crispy , pink pasta, butter chicken Risotto. While in drinks i ordered - hot chocolate, heman, dil mange more.Nachos was excellent as it's the most Instagrammable dish. Excellent quantity of nachos. While chicken crispy was not that best because it was little sweet. Rest everything was excellent. No doubt service was excellent, despite of being so pack house the food was not delayed.Overall it's a wonderful place to chill. I am visiting this place again just to try more from the menu.",2
"It's a very nice and happening place, food here is delicious and it's worth the price they are offering for. One of the nicest place I've recently been to. They have good Indian cuisine with complementary Bollywood retro music. Overall it's a perfect place with good food. Also, do not forget to try mocktails.

"Hitchki (BKC) - The place is just perfect as it sounds, it has a very good setup. You can visit at anytime of the day and the same charming and elegant. As you enter you the restaurant, staff gets you comfortably seated. The place has music playing in the background and the food here is just delicious. The staff is very helpful and coretous. Our favourite from this was, Pink Sauce Pasta, He- Man (mocktail) and sweety Tweety and for dessert we loved the banoffe bomb (caramelized banana + pecan nut + banana cake + chocolate + salted caramel) and jungle mein mangal! The place after this meal has just become my go-to place!",2
The overall experience was Very nice. Wonderful presentation of all the items... Great menu... Everything on the menu is with a wonderful twist. Quantities are wholesome... Has a lovely ambience. Must try imli ka boota cocktail... Will cost about Rs. 1000 per person.,2

"This was my second visit to Hitchki BKC. This outlet is located at First International Financial centre in G block of Bkc. The same building which houses Citibank‚Äôs corporate office.In comparison to the outlet outlets of hitchki in mumbai, I find the bkc outlet to be the most lit one followed by Powai. This outlet attracts young corporate crowd who work in the vicinity.The ambiance inside the outlet is lit. They have this unique Bollywood themed menu and descriptions of the items on the menu are eye catching.The staff is young, courteous well mannered and caters well. The DJ needs a special mention as he keeps the crowd grooving with his tracks.Coming to the food, I have always been a big fan of both their menu, the quality and quantity of food and this recent experience was no different.We ordered for the below dishes , drinks and desserts -CocktailsPudin hara Jinito - gin based mojitoBoot - e - Licious - A kind of LIIT served in a cute boot shaped glassDum maaro dum - vodka , pineapple juice and cranberry served in a bongSpirit - Ual - LIIT with fruits and red bullClassy drinks and the serving and presentation was on point.FoodTiger Jhinga Hai - well battered tempura prawns popcorn sized pieces with mayo sauceCharlie Chaplie Kebab - minced lamb meat in a round kebab slightly spicy along with mayoMutton chickna - mutton pieces in coconut stew based white gravy with laccha parathaGhee Rice with Roast chickenGreat quality of meat and fish in starters, the quantity of the main course was amazing.DessertCassata Churros - cassata icecream along churrros sticks sprinkled with cinnamon sugar served with caramel syrupKhul Ja Sim Sim - caramel cheese cake with biscuit powder and an ice cream sandwich between Parle G biscuits.Desserts were too good!!!Each and every time was praise worthy. Had an excellent time here and am eagerly looking forward to my next visit.",2
"Some of the items on the menu was great and some was a so-so affair. Non vegetarians will obviously love the place cos of their varied options but unfortunately despite the options of having to choose from a vast menu for vegetarians, some of their dishes are not that great. Maybe its a pub mainly and people don't really visit here for its food or I might be wrong or it was just a bad day for the chef no idea but the rating reflects my disappointment with vegetarian options that we tried. Ambience is good, location is amazing and settings are quite nice too but just the food was a lil off mark. One can try their Chicken Khurana, Virgin Colada (Non Alcoholic), Sweety Tweety (Non Alcoholic), Simon Go Back, Chicken Dhinchak, How's the josh. Recommended for non veg lovers specifically üëç",1
This place has a nice vibe for an outing with friends or colleagues. The service is friendly and the food and drinks are par for the course. Overall good value for money too. It's quite popular in the BKC and gets crowded during peak hours.,2

"HITCHKI surely one of the best places to dine in in Mumbai üòç.I really love the ambience and the music and after 10 pm this place is lit , it's on another level cloud 9 after the Dj arrives .The service and staff is really kind and sweet , they suggest you the genuine best dishes they have to offer from Joe the manager to the server Ashwin every one was really kind to us and suggested us the best dishes available in Hitcki.The things we ordered over here from mocktails to appetizers to main course to Desserts go this way -üî∫ MocktailsüîªüîπSnow white - cinnamon and apple chunks small small pieces of apple in the apple juice , lifting it up it looks really beautiful under lights , the taste is really cool so like apple juice but a lovely mocktail .üî∏ Richie Rich - Strawberry mixed up with green lime and guava , Richie rich is a superb mocktail, I highly recommend it .üîπSweetie Tweetie- peaches and mint mixture the glass is really beautiful and the mint can be felt in every sip of it .üî∏Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi a mixture of tamarind lemon and cran juice this was really a yummy mocktail with the sweet and sour taste of cranberry and sour of lemon and the lil tamarind touch in it .üîª Appetizersüî∫üîπ Crispy Chicken Khurana -chicken pieces or chicken balls which were served in a miniature bicycle and with a chutney vessel which was made like a vessel to measure milk , the presentation was bang on , the taste could be a lil better .üî∏ Fried Corn - These are corn cutlets and they are served with spicy tomato sauce so the sweet taste of corn and cheese is equally balanced with the spicy sauce of tomato. Highly recommended üî¥üîπMy name is Chicken Chilli Chicken - As the name is Chicken chilly chicken tasted really yummy with the schezuan sauce that we ordered to increase the spice and taste of Chicken chilly otherwise the chicken pieces were evenly cooked and the taste with capsicum and onions were pure delight to the tastebuds..üî∫Main courseüîªüî∏Chowmein Fried Rice Chicken -Semi Rice and semi chicken gravy , Chinese dish the fried rice was really good and the gravy blended really well with it , totally a treat to eat.üîª Dessertüî∫üîπ Chocolate Lava kulfi - A pure mixture of hot lava cake and the cold kulfi the combination is deadly , do try this out surely was a treat to watch and eat.üî∏Baratiyon ka Swagat - this Dessert has the best presentation but the taste is something which is okayish there are the old paan pasand chocolate pieces which are used to garnish this is basically a paan Dessert , if you are a paan and chocolate lover you can opt for this though I would suggest chocolate Lava kulfi over this .In the end the service and the staff were really good , special mention for Ashwin who served us beautifully and also Mr Joe who hosted us so well , the presentation and service get a full 5 on 5The starters in chicken can be a lil better but over all food is good and the main course and dessert stole the show , especially the chocolava with kulfi do try it .So overall ratings 5/5",2

"Hitchki is one of the best fusion restaurants I have been to, everything about the restaurant is just bewildering. I went here with a couple of friends and we had the time of our life. First of all the restaurant is huge. There is a lot of seating available. We chose the semi-circular booth which was very comfortable.The menu is a piece of art I must say. The waiter who hosted us was really confident and polite, he guided us through the menu so that we could have the best the restaurant had to offer in line with our choice of cuisines. The music played in the background was not too loud, which is what I want. The choice of music is also great.Talking about the food and drinks we tasted,Beverages:JADOO KI JHAPPI:Teuila with Japanese butterfly pea flower poured in a cylindrical tube which changes colour, it's fascinating to see and even taste.BUBBLY LIIT:A huge Long Island Ice Tea which is made for groups with tequila, gin , white rum, vodka and pineapple juice. It has dry ice which makes the whole drink bubble a lot.Appetizers:PRAWN JAYE PAR:A Taro net basket with parmesan and orange zest with the main ingrident as butter garlic prawn. The prawns are medium sized.CRISPY CHICKEN KHURANA:Big chuncks of boneless chicken fried as tandoori chicken popcorn served with coriander chutney.Mains:SIMON GO BACK:A chicken tikka curry which is based on a dish from England. The south hall curry as they call it, really blissful taste.CHICKEN TIKKA BIRIYANI:The classic chicken tikka biriyani with many dry fruits and boondi raita. The chicken was perfectly cooked and just melted in mouth.Desserts:BANOFEE BOMB:One of the best presentation dessert in the menu, there is so much in there, chocolate, caramelized Banana and a chocolate dome poured on with hot caramel.CHOCOLATE LAVA KULFI:Chocolate lava cake which is busted with malai kulfi and then ozzes out the hot chocolate inside.If you work or are around in BKC then this is the place you should be visiting.",2
"Had family dinner at Utsav during weekday. They are trying to improve over ambience of dine in. There is party hall also available in it.The presentation of food is good. Nothing new in that. Taste is also as per the standard, not in category of awesomeness.Sufficient space 20 people dining in at once.Parking is nearby it but limited. In case of rush you will not get parking nearby.They can try some innovative ideas in presentation or in taste of food.Service is average. Had to ask for water multiple times.",2
"I recently visited Park Balluchi with my family and we all had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was so calming and cozy, with no loud music to distract us from our conversations. The food was delicious and the staff were so kind and helpful. We had a great experience overall and would definitely recommend it for families and couples alike!",2
"The place situated I dealt with good street parking but the service was something that disappointed me a lot . Specially when it came to time . Our order took forever , soup itself was 40 min though it wasn‚Äôt crowded at that point of time . And food came further later . In this heat the place was not cooling up and that become an added issues as more people came coming in. The food was average tasting with Chinese - veg Hakka noodles and manchurian gravy pretty average with soup quality little better . The Indian food naan , paneer and sabji was also average like soundly suggest / like you give it another try",1
Good place with great ambience to dine in with your family.Pros:-1) budget friendly2) clean and hygiene place3) staffs are cooperative4) healthy dishes with taste to rememberCons:-1) Slow service2) South Indian option is not present,2
"Park Balluchi is one of the finest restaurants in the Noida sector 74 area. The food is delicious, although the service could be a bit faster. The drinks, particularly the mojito, were excessively sweet. However, the ambiance is pleasant and overall it's a good place to dine.",1
"The main door needs a change, looks dirty and shabby. The interiors are welcoming. Service is good. Tried tomato basil soup which was very sweet. Pannier Tikka was nice. Veg manchow was also good. Overall, it's a fine place for a neighborhood market.",2
"It‚Äôs ambience was good ,affordable, good for family nd  casual dinner but the food which I ordered (Karara dahi kebab,mashroom do payaza nd tandoori roti) was not up to the mark .",1
"It's a mid size place but quite cozy. You can get many veg and non veg options here. Service, Quality and quantity is quite good. You may not find many dessert options but still good place to hang out with friends n family. Good ambience, peaceful and one of a very few eating option available in this area. Near Park Wisteria.",2
Staff was so so rude and food is also not up to mark!never experienced such bad rude behaviour fromservices team! Only good part is Starter dishes aregood and 1 person not good in service team who isvery aggressive and behave so rude i don't know hisname!..,0
Good food with good ambience but service can be improved little bit.,2
"This is one of the worst places to visit. If you order veg soup they order chicken soup and then they will fight with you. I asked Sir we got wrong soup. The waiter replied,"" ab ho gya toh btao kya karna hai!"".Such rude behaviour and no regret of whatever they have done. My recommendation is to NEVER go here! Worst place to visit.",0
"Excellent place for family dinner , party and other celebrations , food is good , music is good , ambience is good , staff is friendly and prices are good , lot of options to choose from the menu both veg and non veg",2
Go to this place if you have a very big heart to accept bad service and low quantity menu appetite.,0

"Ambience was quiet with low music & good family gentry. Food was really good with reasonable pricing.
They should just work a little on their service part as utensils/glasses seems to be not that cleaned/hygenic which u expect in a fine dine restaurant.",2
"It is nice restaurant in surroundings of sec 7x with good food, ambience...",2
This was the worst place to eatü§Æü§Æü§Æ. Service was very bad with Naan being very thick. Staff tried to fight when we complained about it. Not at all recommended. They ruined our evening.,0
Quality has gone down a lot since our last visit. Restaurant was previously called park balluchi. Won't recomend going here as chef is not good and the staff is rude.,0
"Nice Experience, ambience and food quality was superb.

Services very nice I celebrate my anniversary their staff is very cooperative I am planning to visit again with my family,2
Nice ambience is what I feel when I entered this restaurant ...Was chilling with friends and enjoyed there snacks ...Tandoori bhuna chicken is a must try because of the tenderness and if you love a bit of spice then you should have this.Service was also nice,2
"It was my parents anniversary So we decided to there, the infrastructure were pretty cool . Waiters behavior is the main thing which I like the most there they were very calm and polite which they should be . Talking about food , they serve it very fast and very well , asked my mother  can I serve you and served us by the own .",2
"Tasty food and decent ambience. Park balluchi has very catchy interior. I had paneer tikka masala, dum aloo, paneer butter masala and kadhai paneer. The taste of all dishes were very good. You can enjoy a meal with your family and friends there.",2
Cheats. We ordered full chicken and they delivered 4 small pieces. Quality is rotten,0
Not good for Chinese cuisine but it's very good for North Indian food.,2
"Starters (both veg and non veg) are good. In main course Paneer lababdar is good in taste. However the Garlic was told to be thin and crispy, the instructions were not followed. Ambience is average. Normally the people staying nearby take their services for celebrating Birthdays, etc. I have tried their food on several occasions. I do not have anything real negative to report. Only that they need to improve on hygiene in washrooms. It is better to book the seat before going on weekends because the place gets crowded if u go late without any prior booking.",2
"I like the food here. Good ambience. But a bit slow service, not bad though.
Overall a good place for a family dinner.",2
"One of the most jhantu and madarchod restro
Dont go. For this.
Their staff don't know the professionalism..",0
"Food was yummmm, ambience was good, staff was very friendly.",2
"Food is very good but the service was very delayed. First in cleaning the vacant table, then serving the water, taking the order and finally in serving the dishes.",2
"Nice place, nice interior and tasty food...
Well trained and groomed staff, we are there for dinner on Valentin night, restaurant welcoming with a delicious cake and candle light for all...",2
Utterly disappointed with the starter. Ordered Chicken Reshmi Kabab and Kashundi Fish Tikka. Kashundi fish tikka was tasteless and Chicken Reshmi Kabab was below average.They don't even have much options for mocktails.Did not order main course seeing the starter quality.,0
"We went for dinner and have to wait for 30-35 mins to get order. Service was very very slow. It was like everyone was responsible for everything which means no one is responsible. This did not happen for first time, looks like it's their habit or service standards. I am giving 3 star only because of taste.",1
Food is ok and ambience was nice but  lights Were very dim and dark ...more lights can enhance the feel..,2
"Delicious and Well Prepared Food!
Loved the visitüëç",2
"I had organised a birthday party of 30 people. They charged me 750 per person. It was very Bad experience.1. Food was Average. Could be much better.2. They promised me DJ will be provided by them. They Come up with a Chinese small speaker and playing songs on Youtube. Ads were coming every 10-15 mins.3. The party room was not well ventilated. Everyone was sweating. We asked them switch on the AC but they said ACs are not working.4. The Service was way too slow.. Most of our guests have to wait for 30 mins for Rotis. Most of them left midway.5. They behaviour was too rude. We complained our slow service, Manager said they accepted their mistake. They will improve in future but today they cannot do anything. Service will be slow.6. After cake cutting, Waiters take the Cake to kitchen. We keep asking about cake but they were confused who took the cake. They returned the cake when Party ends.Please don't ruin your parties. You'll find better Restaurants with same price.",0
"The food is yummilicious....The ambience is so calm...Perfect place for family, friends, family gatherings, birthday celebrations, etc...The hospitality of the waiters is very warm and prompt.",2

"Park Balichi is a good place for Dinning.
The food is good .
The decor needs to look into.
That will make a difference.",2
Good service with tasty food. They are always ready to help you. We had a party and they helped us with the cake distribution and sitting arrangement.,2
Good part:Food is awesome.Peaceful ambience.Decent interior.Quick service.Not-so-Good part:Staff is not keen on getting us a table. We have to point out a vacant table then they got us placed.Food was not served.Wheelchair accessibility: Elevator facility is available. ,1
"The food is absolutely amazing!
The perfect place for family dinners, reunions, parties and so much more.
Loved it! Highly recommended",2
Starter was good but main course was just ok,1
"Ambience awesome. Food tasty. Party can organise here for approx 100 people.
Veg Platter sufficient for 2 people.",2
A great place to spend time with your family. The food is awesome as well as the ambience. Tried multiple items from Chinese as well as Indian. Absolutely no complaints about the food.The portions per plate can be a little more.,2
Had the worst experience with them. They called on their own offering for free dinner which they were doing for promotion of few of their other services. Then in the name of confirmation they kept disturbing continuously. Then we denied form attending the offer event and the whoever called from their team started blaming us for being a liar. Never asked them for any offer. And the caller was misbehaving. Hire better staff and teach them manners.,0
"Sub-standard food. I was amazed by how bad ""dhaba mutton"" can be. The starters were stale and I would prefer to eat street side than in this place.
Serving takes an eternity as though something special is being prepared in the kitchen. But, the end product is a very very bad experience.",0
"The concerned fellow Dilip at the restaurant did not help to deliver the ordered food or allowed me to pick up the food when zomato cancelled the order, even when the latter asked me to feel free have the order picked directly from the restaurant. The restaurant kept the food and have the payment refunded in their account. This is how hospitality functions at park ballbchi noida.",0
"We often go to this restaurant. It's a good eating Joint in Central Noida which is basically the 7X sectors. I like the place as in its ambience is decent, the service is also fine & the food is good. And above all the value for money is quite good as it's not very pricey but it's not cheap as well. I like their grilled fish tikka a lot, their rasmalai is also tasty, their fresh lime also I found good, & we have tried their other dishes as well primarily non veg which were also satisfactory. In all the overall experience for this place is good & we have experienced it many a times.",2
Day by day service and quality of food is detonating.,1
"Good place, food was amazing and so was the staff, it needs better placing of chairs or just the crowd is weird idk... but there is something off about this place.Food is a little spicey, suit to your liking if you do not prefer spicey food ,don't go here",2
"Bad experience visiting today just 10 minute ago, it was booked for party hence he hardly gave any respect to us and offered us - yahan baithna hai to theek hai else carry on type.There were days when it was newly opened and we were the one who gave business. now once he is settled and full for today, this is how employees are treating others.Don‚Äôt you worry , days comes and go .Cheers !",0
"We dined yesterday at Park Balluchi , sce 77 Noida. We had Dahi ka sholey, Tandoori roti and Pindi chole.. all the items seemed fresh and delicious.  Staff behavior and atmosphere are also good in this restaurant.  I recommend this restaurant to veg and non veg both people.",2
A very good fine dining restaurant. Food quality and taste is nice. Dal makhni and butter chicken is a must try here.,2
I didn't liked it. The food we were expecting is way more different and we recieved stale chicken too. The order took more time and every time they were saying only one minute. Not that i was expecting at all.,0
"Perfect place, not to crowded tasty food, polite staff",2
"Park Balluchi, I went there after I had ordered something from them for a good friend. This place will really be amazing if you're craving for some good masala-rich food. And they do really take care that masala is a lot more than just red chilli. The staff is humble and the seatings are comfortable. The menu is limited but whatever they have I think I am gonna try. If you are a non-vegetarian, I'd suggest you eat their Chilli Chicken Dry, it's nothing like your regular chilli chicken, you'll know what I mean when you eat it.Vegetarian options: You'll find a lot of vegitarian options from starters to main course.Parking: It's a complete complex, your Vehicle can be parked on the road outside.Kid-friendliness: Yes, this is a completely kid friendly space with. The menu also has a lot of things that kids would order right away.Wheelchair accessibility: Yes, you can use the lift.",2
"Visited first time, ambience was nice but AC water was dropping from the ceiling. Also ordered a Soft Drink which was never served after multiple reminders. Food was more than Average.",1
"It's an awesome place to have any meal.. the staff is just so welcoming and sophisticated that you can compare to best of the 5 stars in and around the city. The food is never a disappointment here. There will always be 1 or 2 of super star dishes in your meal.Prices are not too expensive and not inexpensive either, that's because the food and ambience is worth every penny you spend.",2
"The place definitely needs to change its chef. The food was barely eatable, especially the non alcoholic drinks. We ordered sweet lemon soda which was very sugary. Infact, we felt as if our lips stuck together. Main course was eew. On top of that they charge 7% for there pathetic service. The only good thing is the ambience.",0
"Good ambience, Fast service, Food quality was super. Love to visit again. Just a sugg- guys get your centralised AC fixed, it is a real humid weather and without AC once cant enjoy his/her dinner. Rest all 5*. Today went again after yrs for a gathering of 15 ppl...same as always.. Amazing food, service, ambience..5*Vegetarian options: Multiple optionsParking: Ample market/street parking outsideKid-friendliness: Yes, vry friendly",2
Located just outside my society.... Great place with awesome service and ambience,2
Poor service.. Have been here since the time it opened 2.5 year ago. Still the pathetic service and not so good quality food,0
Good taste and ambience... Visited 3 times in last month and from Indian to chinese cuisine everything is tasty..Starters dahi ke sholey and Hara bhara kabab recommended..Chowmein is also good.Parking: At peak times it may be difficult to find nearby parking.,2
"Went for dinner with family to Park Balluchi sector 77, Noida.Soup was not served very hot. Butter Naan was burnt which was changed on request. Mushroom do pyaza was good.AC Cooling was also not so good.Overall average or little less than average experience.Was little disappointed with the cost of mineral water bottle they charging. I mean over a period of years I started realising that I won‚Äôt be paying rs. 120 for 1 litre of mineral water bottle in those fine dining restaurants. Like 4-5 litre of water itself costing rs. 480 to 600 rs. ( when you can get aquafina n bisleri in much less cost) Though that‚Äôs my personal opinion. It‚Äôs not only specific to this restaurant but with many .Must give deep thought to this.",1
Good Place. Parking is limited though.,2
"Great dine-in restraunt, best for family and friends. Staff is polite and food preparation time is too quick.Its on the first floor in the market place and have plenty of parking area on the road side of around the market",2
"Worth it place with good budget n quality  food, ambience is well maintained",2
"Cold food, cold starters and warm cold drink is what I got in here first time. I am never going there again for that food, seriously only society people go there to enjoy hostel meals. I would prefer a street food vendor rather than going in here..",0
The restaurant has great ambience. The staff is also very polite and friendly. Coming to the main aspect for which one goes to a restaurant......food....Tried new/different dishes that day......highly impressed with all that I ate and would certainly visit  another time. They occasionally put candles on the table for the ultimate candle light dinner experience.,2
"Got sick after having the food. We ordered dal makhani, which didn't taste like dal makhani, and paneer tikka masala which ok ok. Woke up with upset stomach. Bad experience.",0
Good food with delicious experience,2
"Nice ambiance and place.The interior is designed beautifully. I visited there few days back, as per my experience their food was not so good (average- with no taste), their service was very slow wait time can be 20-30 minutes after you place order.  If you are going in weekends you will have a lot of parking issue as it is located in market area in a complex.",2
Very good food and spacious place.,2
"An awesome experience, lovely food I ever eat here. Surly recommended everyone at least should try at once, you will really love it.",2
We have been there for a friend's kid's birthday party. The place is well lit and the food was amazing too. I just feel the staff was less courteous to the guests of the main party hosts. Couple of times I was denied starters/drinks however hosts we're served the same thing. Made me feel as if since they are paying so the staff is looking after them.,2
"Tasteless food. AC ain't sufficient for all the tables (get the center table if you want comfort). Get salt, chaat masala, spices etc before ordering food if you are a taste seeker.Also, they'd confirm table booking from dineout, but deny confirmation when you reach there.PS- Not a pathetic experience, but not great either.",0
"The place is staged nicely, service is ok, food is also ok, however, the ac doesn't work properly so it makes you uneasy I had to change my seat because of that... The place is not very good taste wise but if you don't have an option it's ok to eat there",1
Very good service. I am fully satisfied.. specially delicious food & yummy desert . definitely try it without any 2 nd thought.,2
"First time when I visited there, it was a nice and quiet. Waiters were polite and professional. So we gave them 5 stars.Second time it turned out to be a nightmare. I went with my friends, there was so much noise, they took so much time to take our order and they were not familiar about their own system. I mean what the heck, we told them how to redeem a voucher and what exactly they have in their menu.When we asked them to please pack what is left so that we can give it to someone needy. The reply we got was ""We do not have provision to pack leftovers. We reuse it."" ‚ò†Ô∏èI am not going to visit this place ever again neither I am recommending it to anyone.",0
"Food is good , nice ambience,",2
Generally good food! But chicken biriyani was ridiculous. It was completely fake. Some gravy was added to Cooked rice. Can't even call it a biriyani.,1
"Cold food, we asked the waiter to reheat but he was in denial. Naan was like papad. One a good restaurant now Money making has gone into their heads",0
"Nice place to visit
Delicious food
Try atleast once",2
The staff was not at all courteous they were litterally bangging the dishes and all. Also the food didn't taste too good. It was ok not a very nice experience to be honest.,0
"Thank you Park Balluchi for the wonderful experience.The food was super delicious, both veg and non veg items were awesome and not only the snacks but main course too. Amritsari fish tikka, drums of heaven, dal balluchi and mutton roghan josh were awesome.Great service and cleanlines.",2
Food was good but bit costly. ambience was good.,2
"I have visited this place multiple times with my wife, and adore the food and ambience. We ordered dahi kebab, paneer tikka for starters, malai kofta and paneer butter masala for main course. Food is delicious, seating and ambience is comfortable, service is quick, staff is humble, rates are reasonable.I would recommend this place particularly if you want to go with family.",2
Good ambition and testy food. Food quality and quantity both good. Must try bemishal Chicken if you non veg lover.,2
food is expensive and is not at  par with the qualty served and charged by the customer there are much better otions available in the vicnity,1
"A perfect hidden gem of a place. The ambience is contemporary, with plenty of space to move around and a decent amount of windows. The staff is very helpful in conducting events and parties. They'll even let you rearrange the place to have a closed group sort of event.The food is brilliant with a key highlight being the amazing veg and nonveg starters",2
The place was noisy due to a birthday party being held in the main hall. This deprived the other guests of much required quiet. The service was good  . Food quality was also good. The parking was not easily available.,1
Food was really tasty and having a nice ambience. This is a family restaurant. Service is also good.Vegetarian options: Their Daal is super delicious.Kid-friendliness: Starters for kids are really good.,2
"Yesterday my wife ordered food but seriously it was horrible total waist of money
Even my daughter didn't like at all
Shame on you .",0
Today I ordered Punjabi chicken curry which I found to be worst chicken dish I have ever eaten. Gravy had no taste and chicken was uncooked. Very bad taste not recommended at all.,0
Good restaurant and service. I went to the party hall and it was nicely arranged. Food was good in taste,2
"Terrible Chinise food. They prepared chowmin in over used oil affecting the taste of the food badly.
Indian food is decent.",0
Food was ok... Little problem in their AC,2
Nice place for three time meal with some special dishes and booking for parties as well taken..,2
"Bad experience visiting  Today.
It was full today due to some party, hence he talked very rudely.
I would recommend to visit only when no other option you have.",0
"The worst food I have ever had with such a nice property....We tried multiple dishes, so that we can fulfill but failed. Pl don't ever go there, you will ruin your occasion. Also they charge 18% GST on food instead 5%.",0
"To cut a long story short, I felt scammed.So I and my family recently went to dinner here. It was supposed to be a festive and celebratory dinner, but it was indeed the opposite.Upon taking our seats, one of the managers asked us whether we were staying in the hotel or had a Dineout reservation, we told him the latter.Food was just about average. Some things were decent, while others absolutely not. The waitstaff were either disinterested or non existent. We finished our dinner and then comes the surprise: the bill.Before going here, I had called ahead and spoken to one of the employees here (Mr Sohit). I had asked him the charges for the dinner and he had informed me it would be Rs 1,600 AI/head. Yet when it was time to pay the bill, the manager tells us it is Rs 9,400. Apparently, if one chooses to pay via Dineout the charges are astronomically higher (Rs 2,350 AI/head). This was an absolute shock to us, and after a little back and forth we paid up and left. This felt like an absolute scam and was not informed to us either on call or when we had taken our seats.I and my family did not have a good time and we will not be returning to this establishment.",0
sir aap ki so good lekin sir aap ko The cukinary Court k naam se website banwani chahiye ki log jaldi se attract ho sake. I m website developer. So mai aap ki website budget me bana dunga sir.,2
Nice place and food is also good.. bt quite expensive.. service is good bt food served was cold. Overall taste is good.,2
"I am not very happy with this place after I dined here recently fo  lunch buffet. I did my booking from #swiggydineout. First of all, the items listed on buffet menu on dineout were not there on the menu , secondly the items which were there were not that great in taste, refill was slow and the staff had to be reminded again and again. They are charging you a good amount per pax in buffet( I paid 6.5k for 6 PPL). The saddest part was the payment. I made the payment via #swiggydineout itself but the restaurant didn't provide bill before I made payment. They provided bill only after I made payment and it had 5percent service charge included !!! This was not informed to me before making payment. On top of it they are making you pay separately for water bottles which I didn't even ask for.Overall, nothing like a 4 star property experience. You can avail better options in this price",0
"Awesome ambience with delicious food. A really lavish buffet laid down. Overall nice place to eat especially considering the rates, value for money.",2
A truly fine dining restaurant. Sophisticated environment and food options. You can spend quality time with family here. Staff behaviour and hospitality is remarkable.,2
A combination of great food and luxurious ambience combined with a very cooperative and friendly staff. An amazing option to go for when choosing to go for a meal.i certainly would recommend taking the buffet option which offers a much wider array of culinary origins to try rather than going for a la carte. If you are a Zomato Gold user do avail the 1+1 offers that are regularly available for this place. Worth every penny!,2
"I recently had the misfortune of dining at Culinary Court, and it was undoubtedly one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've ever had. From the moment I stepped foot into this establishment, I was greeted by a lackluster atmosphere that reeked of negligence and indifference.Let's start with the service, or should I say lack thereof. The waitstaff seemed utterly disinterested in their job, displaying a complete lack of attentiveness and professionalism. It took an eternity for anyone to even acknowledge my presence, and when they finally did, they seemed annoyed by my mere presence. Their disorganized approach resulted in long waits between courses, leaving me frustrated and hungry.Now, let's move on to the main event: the food‚Äîor should I say, the culinary catastrophe. The menu boasted a variety of dishes, but the execution was abysmal. The appetizers were bland and lacked any semblance of creativity. The presentation was lackluster, as if they were hastily thrown together without any thought or care. The flavors were muted, and the ingredients appeared to be of subpar quality.As for the main course, it was an absolute disaster. The dishes arrived cold, as if they had been sitting out for far too long. The meats were overcooked and dry, while the seafood tasted stale and unappealing. It was clear that the kitchen staff had no concept of proper seasoning or balancing flavors. Each bite was a disappointment, leaving me longing for a proper meal elsewhere.To add insult to injury, the prices at Culinary Court were exorbitant for the dismal quality of food and service provided. I left feeling both unsatisfied and robbed, as if I had been scammed into paying for a culinary nightmare.In conclusion, Culinary Court is a restaurant that fails to deliver on every level. From the apathetic staff to the abominable food, it is an establishment that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the disappointment and seek out a dining experience worthy of your time and money elsewhere.",0
"Highly overrated place, inaccurate reviews..Visited the place and it is no doubt built good and has decent ambience.Buffet Food menu looked very extensive but it was literally bland.. Right from the starters, it just seemed like tasteless..on top of it, the service was very poor, we had to constantly ask them to refill the empty plates glasses and bowls in the buffet counter which should have been taken care of by themselves.Don‚Äôt go with a 4.1 rated restaurant expectation as it is hardly a 3 overall and food literally sucks.",0
"They are frauds, completely fraud! Never ever visit them.

Qoute astronomical numbers like 2350 when paying through dineout and qoute 1250 + tax AI when on call.",0
"The food options will turn you off. It‚Äôs really difficult to decide what to eat, not coz options are too many but they are weird. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúwater water everywhere, Not a drop to drink‚Äù. Dessert spread makes you feel like you are at a Indian sweet shop. No good continental food or desserts.Really low standards of food with the kind of money being charged. Highly Disappointed !!Don‚Äôt waste your money. Period.",0
"Great place, nice ambiance well complimented by lip smacking food and flawless hospitality.",2
"We Loved this place, their food quality is very good and its pocket friendly.. One of staff member  name Gulshad he was really awesome and offered us complimentary stuff. All in all i will  recommend to others too...",2
This place is situated in Park Ascent sector 62 noida. The ambience is nice and staff is quite friendly however food is average. On value for money i would rate 6/10,1
Awesome food. Ultimate ambience and great place to visit,2
"I have been a regular to the culinary court for thr buffet. However, when I went last Saturday I was surprised to see the decline in service and food quality. The staff especially thr on floor manager - Naveen was rude and has superiority complex. He ensured my dining experience was spoiled. Food quality and taste has degraded with time and prices have increased. NOT RECOMMENDED.",0
The Culinary Court offers sumptuous breakfast maintaining the balance between health and taste. Variety from conti to Indian to baked items... From team coofee milk cold coffe and fresh juices... You get all... The hotel stay was a pleasant experience. One should come here if in Noida Sector 62... Naveen and his team will be there to cater to all your needs and ensure that you have a good time! Keep up the good work!,2
Amazing Experience!I went there for dinner and selected the buffet option. The variety was great for appetisers and desserts. Service was on point. Great experience overallHighly recommended.,2
All that shines is not gold...the saying holds true for this place. Service is not upto the mark and prices are too high...the calculations are done some weired basis due to which you cannot get bills revised easily even if u see a mistake.Vegetarian options: Food was average but serving was very poor,0
this is the best place for staying. all facilities are available which i want. So my experience in Culinary court is best. so everybody i recommend you to go their one time in your life .All rooms are luxerious .,2
Perfect place for family with best comfort and delicious food,2
"The food tasted pathetic and bland. I ordered Kadai paneer, paneer makhani and dal tadka, all three had least flavor/ spices. The taste doesn't justify the price they are charging. Not sure how come this restaurant has other reviews which are praising the food taste and quality. Atleast based on my experience, I wouldn't visit this restaurant again.",0
So we went by the zomato app the staff was very attentive and the buffet spread was nice especially thanks to Mr.naveen who is very careful about his service..Thanks to culinury team,2
Very good services with variety of options in terms of food and nice place for meeting and parties,2
"Review for The Culinary Court :Ambience : Ambience is good, well lit place, bar placement is also good. Seating is comfortable, well spread and spacious.Food quality : Food quality is great, starters are limited, but cooked well. Main course have enough options. All of them are nicely cooked and taste good. Desserts are in plenty and great.Bar menu : They have good no. of brands for wine, whiskey and beer. They offer 2+1 on drinks.Service : Service quality is kind of mixed bag.Some are great in their duty, some are just there for the name sake.Parking : They have valet parkingMeal price are in mid range, not too expensive nor economical.",2
"Ambience is good, food was just warm and not hot so didn't really like it. Plus being vegetarian and having most of the dishes made of potato is not pretty impressive. Though dessert were good and so was the mixed fruit juice. Overall it was decent enough experience.",2
"Very average, though price is higher in comparison to any BBQ,will not recommend it over any BBQ",0
"Very good buffet. Good taste. Very courteous wait staff. Though spread can be better. Having complimentary drink would be great. Also having more beer options will be a big plus.Still considering prices in Noida, I would call the buffet value for money.",2
"So if you visit here for a lunch on a working day, you will be getting the best service and a good enough ambience, especially to host a large group. But a dinner or a weekend trip means lots of rush and footfall, which is not so appealing to many.I recommend the buffet for a large headcount and a la carte for a small group.As for the food, the starters are good, but the main course can be better. The desserts and sweets though are many and will appeal to all.  And don't forget to enjoy the happy hours!",2
Staff there treats themselves as superior and customers as inferior!!!!! Hotel management must teach their staff how to treat customers if they are into Hospitality sector.,0
"My actual rating is 4.5 . Loved the  place, taste of food & its quantity served, cleanliness all over . Valet parking is an additional benefit there.",2
"Good place with loads of personal touch. Awesome ambience with delicious food is how one can describe this place. A really lavish buffet laid down in front of you takes you by surprise. Overall nice place to eat especially considering the rates, value for money.",2
"Over-priced for Noida.
It's not even that great! Too expensive",1
Service is quite slow and most of the dish are not well cook specially Pasta and Pizza. Space is good but for small groups not more than 20 . Mocktail choice are less here and cake section is also average. Sometime you may also find wrong dish name also.,1
"Went for lunch buffet yesterday...quality and taste has gone down from pre-lockdown times. Starters like chicken roast, tikka etc were cold and hard. Very limited main course. Desert also tasteless, you will get much better gajar halwa in a regular mithai shop.Better go to any other 4 star or BBQ restaurant and dont waste money here.",0
They prefer customer to order only buffet only,2
"They have some absolutely wiered kind of food, placed in some very awkward manner.. they have potential to spoil any mood. Go there at your own risk. Trust me, I'm not being biased or sarcastic here.. I really mean it. Their staff will make you feel really sorry for your decision, just in case you really end up being there.",0
"Great place for choice of verity of multi cuisine.
Buffet is awesome.
A must try.. Delicious very delicious üëç",2
Good choice of menu. Service staff are good. A little costly as per the food choice. Need to look for more offers for corporate and repeat clients. Overall experience was good.,2
Ignorant and non cooperative staff. They gave wrong information about the offers and during billing they retracted their statement thereby costing us extra. Very poor experience,0
"Be careful, they overcharged me for my guest count. When I said to review they insisted they were correct. Then my wife made a guest list and told them about exact numbers they did not agree and kept resisting. We insisted on CCTV. Their restraunts manager after reviewing agreed and told us he would request a refund. But next day I got a call by the restraunt manager that their security head on GM's instructions has reviewed the CCTV again and they found that the Guest Count they billed was correct. Though it very rude to confront your Guest after an agreement but the General Manager -GM not only insulted me their Guest but his own Restraunt Manager. He just didn't trust his own staff. So I went and met third security head of a 4-5 star hotel. who played CCTV again and counted me and my wife twice. I was just shocked. If he can't recognize me after watching CCTV again and again. What the hell is happening with the Guests security in that Hotel. Pathetic, totally pathetic service experience dealing with such arrogant hospitality people. They all put the blame on waiting staff who counted my Guests. They even issued a warning letter to him. Where GM of the hotel should have taken responsibility for such pathetic experience they just passed the buck.  They spoiled my day and experience. And they refunded the money after 15 days. I pity the guests, they are horror for any Guests. The group should seriously look for replacing their arrogant and ill mannered General Manager. I would have given them 0 stars but that not an option. A hotel should understand, how well they cook and decorate but If they mis behave with their Guests. they have done biggest blunders of Hospitality industry and this hotel - Park Ascent, sector 62 did just that.",0
"I been to this hotel fir dinner on 16th july 2021As we been there to eat cold food in hot ambience means foot was totally cold and ac was not working in the month of hot summer july , staff are totally in their own world nt at all listing to you, and food was totally tasteless ,i think they hire some pahadi chef means bahadur to prepare the food and service was like tortoise can win the race as i got my snacks after 1 hr now you think how much slow we got our food totally waste of my money and menu prices are overprices as per the place they are situated its better to go to roadside eatery  rather come to this pathetic place",0
"Easy option for small/medium corporate parties and family functions.. Full marks for hospitality, the staff's behaviour, presentations, serving, minimal waiting time, environment and the aura..However, food taste and variety are some aspects that can be worked upon..All in all, a nice experience",2
Great experience tasty food good service. Staff was extremely good . We enjoyed our evening during our first visit. Recommended !!,2
Very bad experience. Planned corporate lunch there on 22 dec 2017 for 30 people. They shared a menu on mail 2 days ago but when served they served nothing comparatively and the reason was our menu is on circular basis. Recommend all corporates to refrain from visiting them as we felt cheated,0
"What a lovely experience... special thanks to the fine dining team - Amar, Rohtash and their kind employees who went out of their way to make our family feel at home for a whole week. Really tasty food and friendly people... many thanks!",2
"Food was too good and the ambience was also very beautiful. Everyone had their mask and gloves on, and special mention to the manager was very very helpful and cooperative.",2
"Amazing hospitality , food was amazing. Far better than of  lot top hotels. Staff & Manager was amazing. Must visit .",2
