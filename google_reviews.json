It's like they know customers will rush in no matter what so whats the point of a friendly approach!!As such I try to avoid such places where the basic respect for a customer is missing!!"

But now things are much changed now The quality of food, sweets and snacks re very much degraded. Now much people started preferring other sweet shop now. In last 6 months, I have tried snacks as well as sweets but the quality is not up to mark. In sweets the quantity of sugar has very much increased. In snacks, the quality is very degraded and started to cook much spicy.I think owner started to focus more on business then the quality of food. I will they will improve soon and serve better food to the people."

But the restaurant and their staff is wierd also the food is not so good.. I ordered for one plate bhatoora chana they brought 2 .. I ordered for extra pav for pav bhaji they brought extra bhatoora.. I ordered paneer pakode and they are serving it without chutney can you imagine? These guys have chaat counter! and they cant serve chutneys! i asked for chutneys with chana bhatoora they refused..But when i asked chutneys for paneer pakoda they then said ya okay we will bring it then also they are giving only brown chutney and saying you asked for only sweet one! ( Which was their assumption).. I asked for both the chutneys..Lastly the paneer pakoda was not at all fresh and my whole family has suffered from indigestion..Also they didn't served chilled mojitos..Their service is really very badly managed.. I think they should give a proper training to their staff..Also i didn't liked the way they have managed their counters it becomes really confusing for a person visiting first time in their outlet... They should atleast put some labels near their counters ,for example Billing section , bakery section , reception etc..I experienced a lot of flaws and would hope that they could improve that.. Otherwise there is a good opportunity for their restaurant section atleast!..I would never try this place again for food atleast.."
