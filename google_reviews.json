    "review": "We had a very nice dinner at Peshwari. Great ambiance, delicious food. Our waiter helped guide us to some great menu selections.A few notes on the negative side. They couldn't find our reservation even though we had a written email confirmation - turned out it wasn't a problem to get seated but the place ended up completely packed so it's a good thing we arrived early. Also, when our appetizers came out we had to ask for a fork and knife since there were none at the table. We had to ask 3 times before they were provided to us, and the manager's excuse was that these were really finger foods we should eat with our hands... And finally, the prices are steep, but I guess it goes with the class of hotel the restaurant is located in.In spite of this, it was a great dinner experience and we would eat there again!",

Thanks to all the attending waiters and explaining the history of recipe which we have choosen and those belongs to signature menu. Also surprised to know some of their menu and recipes are originated from Uzbekistan\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddff. Only difficult part of the restaurant is no close by washroom for which we need to go out of the restaurant.Another new experience is that we will not be provided any spoon and fork and will have to eat by own hand to maintain taste probably and also to maintain traditions I guess.Overall it's a very good experience indeed in terms of food quality and and service and ambience. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4fFood & drinks: Good.",

We were not given any utensils, even the black bean dal (which is to die for here, so good), we had to use our hands.Portion sizes are large, and a bit on the heavy side. So you\u2019ll likely end the meal feeling like you can\u2019t walk. But worth it.",

We went there for our stay in ITC and we had Breakfast and Dinner there.Look wise the restaurant is spectacular and hospitality is good too and if I talk about food they usually serve Indian and continental and the taste was really good.Indian cuisine offered was really delicious and we really liked the dinner menu there though it wasn't offering more varieties in the menu as compared to the other 5 stars hotel and if I talk about the Breakfast, the menu was limited and few of the things we didn't like but overall it was not that bad.At last we had a nice stay there with good food.",

However, I must say that the pancakes with maple syrup were delicious, and the omelette was a real treat. The ambience of the restaurant was stunning, which added to the overall experience. They had a wide variety of tea cakes to choose from. They also had diverse range of Indian dishes, including dosa, idli, chole bhature, sabudana khichdi, aalo paratha etc. On the downside, the bacon was a disappointment as it was overcooked and difficult to chew. Nevertheless, the staff were incredibly polite and accommodating.",

My second tandoori bread took far too long and by the time it arrived all other food was ice cold .I skipped dessert because did not want to be disappointed further.

Do try Mutton n chicken Dum  Biryani with mirchi ka salan.  Now coming to the dessert which has lots of variety but  the indian sweets win the heart that besan laddus n hot piping imratis are the best. Mac n cheese is perfect. Breakfast was always lovely. Staff is helpful, hardworking and courteous . On special request they even made delicious dessert and kids meal.  Would like to visit again.",

At many places, lot of dishes are added to a brunch just to add to the count and after trying them one feels they were better skipped. At Peshwa Pavilion, not one dish seemed to be out of place. Even the minute details like chutneys and papads were top notch. We thoroughly enjoyed everything, the seafood section needs a special mention - baby lobster, Bombay duck, prawns, variety of fish, octopus, sushi! The dessert section was also phenomenal. Lost count of how many servings we took of the jalebi rabdi. Even the pastries and eclairs was amazing. All and all a definite 5 star rating for the experience!!",

After 17hr long flight, I was looking forward to this dining experience, literally speaking.The following sums up my experience-Fancy cocktail names, all taste like rasna with no or little alcohol (needless to say, cost when converted to $ was expensive compared to far better cocktails I get back at home) .. totally avoidable.Set menu will not be served to a table of more than one person even if every one wants to order their own set menu and not share it, no clear reason why, apparently set menu was only if a person was dining alone and sitting alone at the table - unreal and weird! Service was the worst ever, extremely understaffed. We had to go and ask for help every single time and I was met with frown every time. Food is good but there almost a non existent vegetarian menu. Dal tasted good.Clearly not a five start hotel worthy.",

There were a bunch of starters, some great, some OK. Similarly, the flatbread (laccha paratha, naan) were good, but paneer makhani was OK. Among desserts, gulab jamun was amazing (very freshly made), kulfi, rabdi etc were good but not great.Overall, tough to say it was worth it, cos it's really expensive.

    "review": "Located inside ITC Maratha, this is one restaurant known for their yummy Dal Bukhara and a luxury dining experience. The seating is comfortable with large wooden tables and benches. Service staff is well mannered and very knowledgeable. The pricing is a bit on the expensive side.We opted for a vegetarian & a non vegetarian set three course menu consisting of starters, mains and desserts.The vegetarian starters consisted of Tandoori Aloo, Tandoori Salad & Subz Seekh. Decent in terms of flavour, but we didn't find this extra ordinary, unlike the non vegetarian starters, Murgh Malai Kebab, Reshmi Kebab & Peshawri Kebab, which were truly mouth watering. All of them were tender and moist, the balance of flavours was outstanding and the quantity was great too..\ud83d\ude0dThe main course was Paneer Makhni for vegetarian menu & Murgh Makhni for the non vegetarian and Dal Bukhara in both served with a choice of Indian Bread. Dal Bukhara was simply too good and something one wishes to have more of..\ud83d\ude0bFor dessert we requested for Kulfi & Rabdi. Both were delicious and were the perfect end to such a lovely meal. We also had Watermelon juice and Sweet Lime Soda to help gulp down the food.",

The dal makhani, i never tasted anything like that and the mutton, it was melting in my mouth.

The food is outstanding, the service is abysmal. You can see the back of house staff working in a hot kitchen pretty consistently throughout the night, but expect your server to be inconsistent as well as completely disappear throughout the meal\u2026 if seated at front, you may even assist in the game of flagging servers down to request service for yourself or acknowledgement for the folks walking around looking for help in getting seated.Walkability: Not walkable, not safe. Recommend using a car to get anywhere in Mumbai.Food & drinks: Service is terrible, cleanliness questionable, food is delicious.",

The person was not interested in any order . We booked the table for 10 pm but they gave us table at 10.45 pm and he rudely said you need to give all order in one go .. starters main course everything . When I asked about the menu he replied that scan the QR code but there was no network so asked him to help us which he was little furious.   Even for   spoon and fork we had to request them again and again They don't have jain option not interest to make ( don't know about the chef but the person who was serving us )  and veg options were limited .. after some starters and lassi we had to shift to another restaurant in ITC .Worst experience \ud83d\ude2a..He spoiled our celebrationsVegetarian options: Not much options",

The food is worth it of what you paid for.Great service by the resto's staff and the chef is very friendly.The place is super duper clean and high class.I honestly enjoyed the food/dishes in Peshwari and would highly recommend it.",

The Dal Bukhara is one of their most famous signature dish, a must have. RAS malai was so melt in your mouth soft. The service was excellent. They have put moveable glass privacy shields in-between all tables which we found to be very good. The plate, bibs, water bottle, glass were sealed/packed with sanitation message. This is a great place to enjoy a mughlai meal. Even after a gap of 15 years since I had their Dal Bukhara it's still the same. We also added naan amaal, pudina paratha and Roomali roti all made of whole wheat flour.",

I really felt at home due to the excellent service. Another thing to note, which is not good is that there is no picture of any of the Peshwas out there. You will not find any Peshwa history right from Bajirao 1 to Vishwasrao, Nanasaheb to Sadashivrao, Madhavrao to Baji Rao 2. Even the valiant Chimaji Appa is not mentioned anywhere.The manager told me that they have the paintings in the stock but don't have place to put them. I guess they should really work on that.

It's probably the sloth in me that needs seating (especially at a restaurant) with a back rest.Their tables either seat two or six, the six seater has back rests and a couch, the couple tables have these weird toadstools to sit on and the tables look like tree stumps.I would definitely recommend that they rethink their seating as it's not comfortable at all, specially when the patrons really want to relax and enjoy the amazing food that the restaurant offers.The daal bhukhara is hands down a winner, my serious suggestion - get two bowls of it straight off because that will get polished off the quickest!A special mention of the staffs' uniforms, I love the fact that the management kept the uniforms and the servers foot wear in tune with the resturant theme.",

    "review": "Had been once to Peshawari prior to this visit of mine. And every single time I have just simply loved their food. Located on lobby level of ITC Maratha, Andheri East the USP of this place is to have your food with hands and it tastes divine.I visited Peshawari on a special occasion, my birthday and it was indeed a treat. Ofcourse it was just a week prior that restaurants were allowed to invite guests for dine-in, so lucky me. If you happen to visit the restaurant now, they have big glass partitions to every table so you get your own private space. They have taken a lot of care in terms of hygiene, so utensils are washed, sanitized via UV and packed before being placed on the table so no human has touched the plate before you. Also there is no menu now so you get a digital menu which you scan on the table and check for yourself.On welcome we were treated with a papad platter and green chutney, chutney is superb. Peshawari offers 3 different options in its menu - you can go A-la-carte, Signature Set Menu or Single Diner's Experience Menu. Let me warn you the quantity offered by Peshawari is huge portions. So go for Signature Set Menu only if you have a huge appetite else you may need to pack a lot of food and take it back. Set Menu is priced at 4000 and taxes. We were 2 of us, so we decided the best option for us would be to go for 2 single Diner's Experience Menu. This was priced at 2375 and taxes. It's a 3 course meal with Starters, Main Course and Dessert.This menu comes with 2 pieces of Tandoori Aloo, 1 piece of Subz Seekh and Tandoori Salad as starters. For mains - it's Paneer Makhani and their signature Dal Bukhara. The mains are absolutely divine. Must haves here. You can choose your bread along with the mains. We called for Butter Naan and Cheese Naan. Cheese Naan is super filling I must say. And for dessert you get an option to choose any one from Gulab Jamun, Ras Malai, Kulfi and Phirni. We tried the Gulab Jamun and Kulfi with Falooda, again superb!We had a splendid time at Peshawari, the staff took really good care of us, a special mention for the manager - Mr. Hitesh, extremely helpful and courteous. Thank you Peshawari for making my special day even more special!",

    "review": "Peshawri at the ITC Maratha is an exceptional dining experience that transports you to the heart of the North-West Frontier. The ambience is rustic and intimate, with traditional decor and warm lighting creating an inviting atmosphere.The star of the show, however, is the food. The menu is a celebration of the robust flavors and unique cooking techniques of the Peshawar region, with dishes like the iconic Dal Bukhara and the tender and flavorful Raan-e-Peshawri taking center stage.Each dish is cooked to perfection, with the use of authentic ingredients and spices elevating the flavors to new heights. The service is impeccable, with the staff knowledgeable and attentive to every detail.Overall, Peshawri at the ITC Maratha is a must-visit for anyone looking to savor the best of North-West Frontier cuisine in Mumbai.",

So blissful to be staying with them!Vegetarian options: Oh their daal Bukhara is to die for.... If i have to have daal Bukhara i only go to an ITC Sheraton!",

Staff did take the note of it and served it as well. Coming to the food it was served hot and fresh. However I found very less starter options but overall including veg and non veg were sufficient. Coming to the main course non veg prawn kalwan, mutton Rogan Josh and gosht biryani were the highlight. I just loved there variety of desert section I have seen so many and unique options served anywhere so far. Service provided was very prompt and polite. They are ready to assist and help you even before you can ask. I had an amazing experience here. Hopefully staying with them and enjoying some more feast very soon. Thank you for making it special for me and my family \u263a\ufe0f",

From the moment you walk through the doors, you'll be transported to a world of rich flavors and spices, and the brunch spread will take your taste buds on a journey like no other.The highlights of the meal for me were the kebabs and the biryani \u2013 both were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The naans were also a standout \u2013 fresh and hot, straight out of the tandoor.Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Peshwari. It's the perfect place for a leisurely weekend brunch, where you can enjoy great food, excellent service, and a warm atmosphere.

The rooms are extremely huge, the suites have proper 1 BHK feeling in a room itself. You will find amenities that you probably may not have even imagined, in the room, washroom, and at the kitchen.The food is amazing. You get 4 variety of cheese with bread in the breakfast (just a cheese fan \ud83d\ude13). It's expensive of course, but absolutely worth it.",

I have dined thrice in 16 years and each time the experience just takes me back to the very first delight of experiencing North West Frontier cuisine which so rarely authentic elsewhere among global cities. It\u2019s best to surrender your taste buds to the able service team of Peshawri and let them Floor your senses. My personal favorite is Peshawri Kebab, Murgh Makhani Kebab and Dal Bukhara of course. Do not leave without having the iconic dal Bukhara. Cleatus who took care of us during our visit was so thorough with his knowledge and estimation of our appetite. We really enjoyed every minute of our visit.",
