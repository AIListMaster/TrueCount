    "review": "I recently visited Sindhi Sweets Panchkula with high hopes for a delightful culinary experience. However, my visit left much to be desired. The food quality was subpar, lacking the authentic flavors one would expect from cuisine. The so called navratri food was not at all recommended. Additionally, the service was incredibly slow, to the point where even requesting a spoon seemed like an arduous task. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience and would hesitate to recommend this restaurant to others.",

    "review": "Me and my sister visited there for some snacking.We were out for shopping and after that we wanted to eat something yummy and not so heavy, so we decided to explore newly opened Sindhi Sweets at Sector 11.We tried their Rasmalai, Red velvet pastry, gajar ka halwa, veg puff and Bhalla papdi chaat.Everything looked nice and was served well.The seating area near chaat counter is where we sat. The restaurant looks nice and felt okay, but this seating near the chaat counter felt a bit dark. (Not lit enough)Out of all the things I tried, Gajar ka halwa and Veg puff tasted the best.Rasmalai had a flavour of milk powder/ condensed milk or custard mix.Red velvet wasn\u2019t very fresh, it tasted okay.The chaat was also okay-ish taste wise.Gajar ka halwa on the other hand was really good and perfectly sweet. Veg puff also was flaky and tasted good.We had a nice experience altogether.They have large variety of cookies, gift packs and of course sweets, which look and taste good. :)",

Tried the rasmalai which was above average, though the serving size was decent. I only wish the syrup was little thicker and sweeter. The flavor at the Elante mall shop is far better!The gulab jamun was big and yumm and the rabdi was good.The service was quick and the people behind the counter are polite and helpful.The shop offers a huge variety of delicacies to choose from.Overall the place is great to satisfy your taste buds.",

Second, French fries were not salty. Butter paneer masala was sweet. Now coming to the atmosphere, I feel on Saturdays and Sundays, as if they're giving free food. People waiting in ques to get their chance. The least you wanna do is wait for your food. Even after paying on the higher side you're not getting quality food. Not going again.P. S. The sweet shop is good",

We were group of 10 and none of us could finish individual dishes that were ordered.The great thing was Sweet lassi which we liked and above expectation. But guys your food quality has gone down so bad that we won\u2019t dine ever there. I\u2019m shocked to still think of so worse Chole Bhature.. ideally that must be your signature item on the menu. And when I\u2019m writing this, trust that I\u2019m a food connoisseur and know versatility of food. Your production team needs a real hard work.Service was good and appreciation to them.Genuine feedback by a hotelier.",

It took me 46 minute to get my order that too at last when i asked them i will wait only for 1 minute or i will go then they brought it. Manager, cashier staff was clueless what\u2019s going on. In front of manager after scolding him i asked the new to be customers to not order anything as they are taking so much of time, the manager was not interested in asking them to stay or consoling us to not to do so.

They didn't have even basic etiquettes to talk and were not even concerned about any booking. Very bad experience, was not expecting this from Sindhi Sweet, Sector 9, Pkl. So I got my booking done at some other place.",

At the laat moment of fuction , we have to compromise as no.option was left with us. Rather than feeling sorry, the person at cake counter was talking rubbish and rude. I strongly advice the authority of Sindhi to look into the matter and direct the person to have some manner while dealing with customer because they are paying for the stuff. Really feeling bad...",

The way they were saying no was very very rude. Atleast they can tell us this thing while we were waiting in front of them to get seat. After that we tried other cuisine which was average in taste. Food was at room temperature already. Not planning to go there in future.",

    "review": "Till today Sindhi Sweets was just OK in my food places list. But today it has entered the top 10 food places in Chandigarh. I was craving for having aloo ki subji n puri today, went to atleast 5 places (including gopal's) but either they serve  it on Sunday only or they just have this dish in their menu. Finally, determined to eat aloo puri for breakfast, I reached Sindhi Sweets and I was blessed. Though they are serving bedmi puri (moong dal puri) with aloo subji n chhole but the dish was good. Perfectly spiced, not so oily and you will not feel stuffed after having it. Hence, 5 starts from my side. Worth trying. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dIf anyone can suggest a good place for having aloo puri please do tell in comments.",

It was just 2-3 mins we sat on a vacant table when our waiter asked us to shift to another table because the family next to us had guests coming in and thus wanted adjoining tables which is absolutely acceptable but atleast ensure that the table that you're asking us to move to, is clean and tidy. He hastly wiped and went to the family with adjoining tables. Then we took napkins and ourselves started wiping the table and the chairs. As soon as we settled in, within a minute, he came to our table and rudely told us to order as the restaurant is closing soon. If the restaurant was so worried with the timings then the watchman should have stopped us from entering the restaurant itself. We were not welcomed rather we felt insulted.

The food as compared to Sindhi's in Elante is ok types, not so good in taste. What annoys here the most is their service. The people serving the food here are so irresponsible, don't even care to listen and take orders. If this type of service continues, the day is not far when this place is gonna shut completely!! The management really needs to pay attention to this branch else these people are spoiling such a good brand like SINDHI!!As of now I don't recommend ANYONE going to Sindhi 11 sector, Panchkula..",
