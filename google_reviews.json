        "review": "Me and my sister visited there for some snacking.We were out for shopping and after that we wanted to eat something yummy and not so heavy, so we decided to explore newly opened Sindhi Sweets at Sector 11.We tried their Rasmalai, Red velvet pastry, gajar ka halwa, veg puff and Bhalla papdi chaat.Everything looked nice and was served well.The seating area near chaat counter is where we sat. The restaurant looks nice and felt okay, but this seating near the chaat counter felt a bit dark. (Not lit enough)Out of all the things I tried, Gajar ka halwa and Veg puff tasted the best.Rasmalai had a flavour of milk powder/ condensed milk or custard mix.Red velvet wasn\u2019t very fresh, it tasted okay.The chaat was also okay-ish taste wise.Gajar ka halwa on the other hand was really good and perfectly sweet. Veg puff also was flaky and tasted good.We had a nice experience altogether.They have large variety of cookies, gift packs and of course sweets, which look and taste good. :)"

Tried the rasmalai which was above average, though the serving size was decent. I only wish the syrup was little thicker and sweeter. The flavor at the Elante mall shop is far better!The gulab jamun was big and yumm and the rabdi was good.The service was quick and the people behind the counter are polite and helpful.The shop offers a huge variety of delicacies to choose from.Overall the place is great to satisfy your taste buds."

Although chaats and sweets are much recommended here as they offer freshly prepared motichoor Desi ghee laddoos.Ambience is great.It mostly has heavy rush on weekends.Suggestion - They should add some more combo/ platter food options in their menu.Vegetarian options: This restaurant is pure vegetarian and offers large variety of veg options."

        "review": "Surprisingly the food was horrible when we dined for breakfast last Saturday.The so hyped Chole Bhature were super disappointing, rather the aloo ki sabji given along was better than Chole itself.We had ordered Masala Dosa, Rava Paneer dosa - insane.Who adds coriander leaves in masala dosa - needs good training there. We were group of 10 and none of us could finish individual dishes that were ordered.The great thing was Sweet lassi which we liked and above expectation. But guys your food quality has gone down so bad that we won\u2019t dine ever there. I\u2019m shocked to still think of so worse Chole Bhature.. ideally that must be your signature item on the menu. And when I\u2019m writing this, trust that I\u2019m a food connoisseur and know versatility of food. Your production team needs a real hard work.Service was good and appreciation to them.Genuine feedback by a hotelier."

The place is generally crowded as a lot of people prefer having their meals here so it takes a bit of time usually to get the order delivered but the time taken is worth the wait.

Then I tried their Raj Kachori, which was full of yumminess. Then we ordered mango lassi and vada.Mango lassi was really yumm.I didn't like the taste of Vada as Vada's flavor was just filled with black pepper only. So BIG NO to their Vada.

Last time as well i asked specifically that don\u2019t put too much oil but i guess they don\u2019t listen. In overall i will go again for dosa for sure."

In front of manager after scolding him i asked the new to be customers to not order anything as they are taking so much of time, the manager was not interested in asking them to stay or consoling us to not to do so.
