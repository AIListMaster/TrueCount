    "review": "To cut a long story short, I felt scammed.So I and my family recently went to dinner here. It was supposed to be a festive and celebratory dinner, but it was indeed the opposite.Upon taking our seats, one of the managers asked us whether we were staying in the hotel or had a Dineout reservation, we told him the latter.Food was just about average. Some things were decent, while others absolutely not. The waitstaff were either disinterested or non existent. We finished our dinner and then comes the surprise: the bill.Before going here, I had called ahead and spoken to one of the employees here (Mr Sohit). I had asked him the charges for the dinner and he had informed me it would be Rs 1,600 AI/head. Yet when it was time to pay the bill, the manager tells us it is Rs 9,400. Apparently, if one chooses to pay via Dineout the charges are astronomically higher (Rs 2,350 AI/head). This was an absolute shock to us, and after a little back and forth we paid up and left. This felt like an absolute scam and was not informed to us either on call or when we had taken our seats.I and my family did not have a good time and we will not be returning to this establishment.",

First of all, the items listed on buffet menu on dineout were not there on the menu , secondly the items which were there were not that great in taste, refill was slow and the staff had to be reminded again and again. They are charging you a good amount per pax in buffet( I paid 6.5k for 6 PPL). The saddest part was the payment. I made the payment via #swiggydineout itself but the restaurant didn't provide bill before I made payment. They provided bill only after I made payment and it had 5percent service charge included !!! This was not informed to me before making payment. On top of it they are making you pay separately for water bottles which I didn't even ask for.Overall, nothing like a 4 star property experience. You can avail better options in this price",

    "review": "I recently had the misfortune of dining at Culinary Court, and it was undoubtedly one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've ever had. From the moment I stepped foot into this establishment, I was greeted by a lackluster atmosphere that reeked of negligence and indifference.Let's start with the service, or should I say lack thereof. The waitstaff seemed utterly disinterested in their job, displaying a complete lack of attentiveness and professionalism. It took an eternity for anyone to even acknowledge my presence, and when they finally did, they seemed annoyed by my mere presence. Their disorganized approach resulted in long waits between courses, leaving me frustrated and hungry.Now, let's move on to the main event: the food\u2014or should I say, the culinary catastrophe. The menu boasted a variety of dishes, but the execution was abysmal. The appetizers were bland and lacked any semblance of creativity. The presentation was lackluster, as if they were hastily thrown together without any thought or care. The flavors were muted, and the ingredients appeared to be of subpar quality.As for the main course, it was an absolute disaster. The dishes arrived cold, as if they had been sitting out for far too long. The meats were overcooked and dry, while the seafood tasted stale and unappealing. It was clear that the kitchen staff had no concept of proper seasoning or balancing flavors. Each bite was a disappointment, leaving me longing for a proper meal elsewhere.To add insult to injury, the prices at Culinary Court were exorbitant for the dismal quality of food and service provided. I left feeling both unsatisfied and robbed, as if I had been scammed into paying for a culinary nightmare.In conclusion, Culinary Court is a restaurant that fails to deliver on every level. From the apathetic staff to the abominable food, it is an establishment that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the disappointment and seek out a dining experience worthy of your time and money elsewhere.",

But next day I got a call by the restraunt manager that their security head on GM's instructions has reviewed the CCTV again and they found that the Guest Count they billed was correct. Though it very rude to confront your Guest after an agreement but the General Manager -GM not only insulted me their Guest but his own Restraunt Manager. He just didn't trust his own staff. So I went and met third security head of a 4-5 star hotel. who played CCTV again and counted me and my wife twice. I was just shocked. If he can't recognize me after watching CCTV again and again. What the hell is happening with the Guests security in that Hotel. Pathetic, totally pathetic service experience dealing with such arrogant hospitality people. They all put the blame on waiting staff who counted my Guests. They even issued a warning letter to him. Where GM of the hotel should have taken responsibility for such pathetic experience they just passed the buck.  They spoiled my day and experience. And they refunded the money after 15 days. I pity the guests, they are horror for any Guests. The group should seriously look for replacing their arrogant and ill mannered General Manager. I would have given them 0 stars but that not an option. A hotel should understand, how well they cook and decorate but If they mis behave with their Guests. they have done biggest blunders of Hospitality industry and this hotel - Park Ascent, sector 62 did just that.",
