In last 6 months, I have tried snacks as well as sweets but the quality is not up to mark. In sweets the quantity of sugar has very much increased.

But the restaurant and their staff is wierd also the food is not so good.. I ordered for one plate bhatoora chana they brought 2 .. I ordered for extra pav for pav bhaji they brought extra bhatoora.. I ordered paneer pakode and they are serving it without chutney can you imagine? These guys have chaat counter! and they cant serve chutneys! i asked for chutneys with chana bhatoora they refused..But when i asked chutneys for paneer pakoda they then said ya okay we will bring it then also they are giving only brown chutney and saying you asked for only sweet one! ( Which was their assumption).. I asked for both the chutneys..Lastly the paneer pakoda was not at all fresh and my whole family has suffered from indigestion..Also they didn't served chilled mojitos..Their service is really very badly managed.. I think they should give a proper training to their staff..Also i didn't liked the way they have managed their counters it becomes really confusing for a person visiting first time in their outlet... They should atleast put some labels near their counters ,for example Billing section , bakery section , reception etc..I experienced a lot of flaws and would hope that they could improve that.. Otherwise there is a good opportunity for their restaurant section atleast!..I would never try this place again for food atleast..",

But after making the jalebi he added some previously cooked jalebi into bag. I confronted him and he started arguing with odd behaviour. So i immediately called the head and after discussion they gave me new cooked jalebi.Advice to customers: whenever you buy jalebi just see if they there is previously cooked jalebi coz they will add them and that can be as old as hour or so.",

If you want to have something there itself then you can visit the restaurant on the first floor. You have seniors who are with you and can't use stairs? No worries, lift is present for all seniors. :) There's plenty of well managed space in the restaurant to dine and enjoy food in different group sizes. They also have a separate kitty hall where you can plan your small parties. Food quality is really good. I had Dosa, and Lunch with my family and friends here. It was delicious. Everyone liked it. You must visit this place at least once.",
